h1. Chapter 16: Blocks

h2. Iterator


In this chapter, `BLOCK`, which is the last big name among the seven Ruby stacks,
comes in.
After finishing this, the internal state of the evaluator is virtually understood.



h3. The Whole Picture


What is the mechanism of iterators?
First, let's think about a small program as below:


<p class="caption">▼The Source Program</p>

<pre class="longlist">
iter_method() do
  9   # a mark to find this block
end
</pre>


Let's check the terms just in case.
As for this program, `iter_method` is an iterator method,
`do` ~ `end` is an iterator block.
Here is the syntax tree of this program being dumped.


<p class="caption">▼Its Syntax Tree</p>

<pre class="longlist">
NODE_ITER
nd_iter:
    NODE_FCALL
    nd_mid = 9617 (iter_method)
    nd_args = (null)
nd_var = (null)
nd_body:
    NODE_LIT
    nd_lit = 9:Fixnum
</pre>



Looking for the block by using the 9 written in the iterator block as a trace,
we can understand that `NODE_ITER` seems to represent the iterator block.
And `NODE_FCALL` which calls `iter_method` is at the "below" of that
`NODE_ITER`. In other words, the node of iterator block appears earlier than the call
of the iterator method. This means, before calling an iterator method,
a block is pushed at another node.


And checking by following the flow of code with debugger,
I found that the invocation of an iterator is separated into 3 steps:
`NODE_ITER NODE_CALL` and `NODE_YIELD`.
This means,

#1 push a block (`NODE_ITER`)
#2 call the method which is an iterator (`NODE_CALL`)
#3 `yield` (`NODE_YEILD`)


that's all.



h3. Push a block


First, let's start with the first step, that is `NODE_ITER`, which is the node
to push a block.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_ITER` (simplified)</p>

<pre class="longlist">
case NODE_ITER:
  {
    iter_retry:
      PUSH_TAG(PROT_FUNC);
      PUSH_BLOCK(node->nd_var, node->nd_body);

      state = EXEC_TAG();
      if (state == 0) {
          PUSH_ITER(ITER_PRE);
          result = rb_eval(self, node->nd_iter);
          POP_ITER();
      }
      else if (_block.tag->dst == state) {
          state &= TAG_MASK;
          if (state == TAG_RETURN || state == TAG_BREAK) {
              result = prot_tag->retval;
          }
      }
      POP_BLOCK();
      POP_TAG();
      switch (state) {
        case 0:
          break;

        case TAG_RETRY:
          goto iter_retry;

        case TAG_BREAK:
          break;

        case TAG_RETURN:
          return_value(result);
          /* fall through */
        default:
          JUMP_TAG(state);
      }
  }
  break;
</pre>


Since the original code contains the support of the `for` statement, it is
deleted. After removing the code relating to tags,
there are only push/pop of `ITER` and `BLOCK` left.
Because the rest is ordinarily doing `rb_eval()` with `NODE_FCALL`,
these `ITER` and `BLOCK` are the necessary conditions to turn a method into an iterator.


The necessity of pushing `BLOCK` is fairly reasonable, but what's `ITER` for?
Actually, to think about the meaning of `ITER`, you need to think from the
viewpoint of the side that uses `BLOCK`.


For example, suppose a method is just called. And `ruby_block` exists.
But since `BLOCK` is pushed regardless of the break of method calls,
the existence of a block does not mean the block is pushed for that method.
It's possible that the block is pushed for the previous method. (Figure 1)


<div class="image">
<img src="images/ch_iterator_stacks.jpg" alt="(stacks)"><br>
Figure 1: no one-to-one correspondence between `FRAME` and `BLOCK`
* 上が先端 the end is above
* FRAMEに対応するBLOCKがあるか？ Is there any BLOCK that corresponds to FRAME ?
* ある（けどイテレータではない） Yes. (But, this is not an iterator.)
* ある（本当にイテレータ） Yes. (this is actually an iterator.)
* ない No.
</div>


So, in order to determine for which method the block is pushed, `ITER` is used.
`BLOCK` is not pushed for each `FRAME`
because pushing `BLOCK` is a little heavy.
How much heavy is,
let's check it in practice.




h4. `PUSH_BLOCK()`


The argument of `PUSH_BLOCK()` is (the syntax tree of) the block parameter and
the block body.


<p class="caption">▼ `PUSH_BLOCK() POP_BLOCK()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 592  #define PUSH_BLOCK(v,b) do { \
 593      struct BLOCK _block;                  \
 594      _block.tag = new_blktag();            \
 595      _block.var = v;                       \
 596      _block.body = b;                      \
 597      _block.self = self;                   \
 598      _block.frame = *ruby_frame;           \
 599      _block.klass = ruby_class;            \
 600      _block.frame.node = ruby_current_node;\
 601      _block.scope = ruby_scope;            \
 602      _block.prev = ruby_block;             \
 603      _block.iter = ruby_iter->iter;        \
 604      _block.vmode = scope_vmode;           \
 605      _block.flags = BLOCK_D_SCOPE;         \
 606      _block.dyna_vars = ruby_dyna_vars;    \
 607      _block.wrapper = ruby_wrapper;        \
 608      ruby_block = &_block

 610  #define POP_BLOCK() \
 611     if (_block.tag->flags & (BLOCK_DYNAMIC))              \
 612         _block.tag->flags |= BLOCK_ORPHAN;                \
 613     else if (!(_block.scope->flags & SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE)) \
 614         rb_gc_force_recycle((VALUE)_block.tag);           \
 615     ruby_block = _block.prev;                             \
 616  } while (0)

(eval.c)
</pre>


Let's make sure that a `BLOCK` is "the snapshot of the environment of the moment
of creation". As a proof of it, except for `CREF` and `BLOCK`, the six stack
frames are saved. `CREF` can be substituted by `ruby_frame->cbase`, there's no
need to push.


And, I'd like to check the three points about the mechanism of push.
`BLOCK` is fully allocated on the stack.
`BLOCK` contains the full copy of `FRAME` at the moment.
`BLOCK` is different from the other many stack frame structs in having the
pointer to the previous `BLOCK` (`prev`).


The flags used in various ways at `POP_BLOCK()` is not explained now
because it can only be understood after seeing the implementation of `Proc`
later.


And the talk is about "`BLOCK` is heavy", certainly it seems a little heavy.
When looking inside of `new_blktag()`,
we can see it does `malloc()` and store plenty of members.
But let's defer the final judge until after looking at and comparing with `PUSH_ITER()`.



h4. `PUSH_ITER()`


<p class="caption">▼ `PUSH_ITER() POP_ITER()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 773  #define PUSH_ITER(i) do {               \
 774      struct iter _iter;                  \
 775      _iter.prev = ruby_iter;             \
 776      _iter.iter = (i);                   \
 777      ruby_iter = &_iter

 779  #define POP_ITER()                      \
 780      ruby_iter = _iter.prev;             \
 781  } while (0)

(eval.c)
</pre>


On the contrary, this is apparently light.
It only uses the stack space and has only two members.
Even if this is pushed for each `FRAME`,
it would probably matter little.




h3. Iterator Method Call


After pushing a block, the next thing is to call an iterator method (a method
which is an iterator). There also needs a little machinery.
Do you remember that there's a code to modify
the value of `ruby_iter` at the beginning of `rb_call0`?
Here.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_call0()` − moving to  `ITER_CUR` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
4498      switch (ruby_iter->iter) {
4499        case ITER_PRE:
4500          itr = ITER_CUR;
4501          break;
4502        case ITER_CUR:
4503        default:
4504          itr = ITER_NOT;
4505          break;
4506      }

(eval.c)
</pre>


Since `ITER_PRE` is pushed previously at `NODE_TER`, this code makes
`ruby_iter` `ITER_CUR`.
At this moment, a method finally "becomes" an iterator.
Figure 2 shows the state of the stacks.


<div class="image">
<img src="images/ch_iterator_itertrans.jpg" alt="(itertrans)"><br>
Figure 2: the state of the Ruby stacks on an iterator call.
* 上が先端 the end is above
* イテレータか？（FRAMEに対応するITERがITER_CURか？）
  Is this an iterator? (Is the ITER corresponds to FRAME ITER_CUR ?)
</div>


The possible value of `ruby_iter` is not the one of two boolean values
(for that method or not), but one of three steps because there's a little gap
between the timings when pushing a block and invoking an iterator method.
For example, there's the evaluation of the arguments of an iterator method.
Since it's possible that it contains method calls inside it,
there's the possibility that one of that methods mistakenly thinks that the
just pushed block is for itself and uses it during the evaluation.
Therefore, the timing when a method becomes an iterator,
this means turning into `ITER_CUR`,
has to be the place inside of `rb_call()` that is just before finishing the invocation.


<p class="caption">▼ the processing order</p>
<div class="longlist">
method(arg) <span class="ami">{ block }</span>      # push a block<br>
method(<span class="ami">arg</span>) { block }      # evaluate the aruguments<br>
<span class="ami">method(</span>arg<span class="ami">)</span> { block }      # a method call <br>
</div>


For example, in the last chapter "Method", there's a macro named `BEGIN_CALLARGS` at a handler of `NODE_CALL`.
This is where making use of the third step `ITER`.
Let's go back a little and try to see it.


h4. `BEGIN_CALLARGS END_CALLARGS`


<p class="caption">▼ `BEGIN_CALLARGS END_CALLARGS` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
1812  #define BEGIN_CALLARGS do {\
1813      struct BLOCK *tmp_block = ruby_block;\
1814      if (ruby_iter->iter == ITER_PRE) {\
1815          ruby_block = ruby_block->prev;\
1816      }\
1817      PUSH_ITER(ITER_NOT)

1819  #define END_CALLARGS \
1820      ruby_block = tmp_block;\
1821      POP_ITER();\
1822  } while (0)

(eval.c)
</pre>


When `ruby_iter` is `ITER_PRE`, a `ruby_block` is set aside.
This code is important, for instance, in the below case:



<pre class="emlist">
obj.m1 { yield }.m2 { nil }
</pre>


The evaluation order of this expression is:


#1 push the block of `m2`
#2 push the block of `m1`
#3 call the method `m1`
#4 call the method `m2`


Therefore, if there was not `BEGIN_CALLARGS`,
`m1` will call the block of `m2`.


And, if there's one more iterator connected,
the number of `BEGIN_CALLARGS` increases at the same time in this case,
so there's no problem.




h3. Block Invocation


The third phase of iterator invocation, it means the last phase,
is block invocation.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_YIELD` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
2579        case NODE_YIELD:
2580          if (node->nd_stts) {
2581              result = avalue_to_yvalue(rb_eval(self, node->nd_stts));
2582          }
2583          else {
2584              result = Qundef;    /* no arg */
2585          }
2586          SET_CURRENT_SOURCE();
2587          result = rb_yield_0(result, 0, 0, 0);
2588          break;

(eval.c)
</pre>


`nd_stts` is the parameter of `yield`.
`avalue_to_yvalue()` was mentioned a little at the multiple assignments,
but you can ignore this.
<br>((errata: actually, it was not mentioned. You can ignore this anyway.))<br>
The heart of the behavior is not this but `rb_yield_0()`.
Since this function is also very long,
I show the code after extremely simplifying it.
Most of the methods to simplify are previously used.


* cut the codes relating to `trace_func`.
* cut errors
* cut the codes exist only to prevent from GC
* As the same as `massign()`, there's the parameter `pcall`.
This parameter is to change the level of restriction of the parameter check,
so not important here. Therefore, assume `pcal=0` and perform constant foldings.


And this time, I turn on the "optimize for readability option" as follows.

* when a code branching has equivalent kind of branches,
  leave the main one and cut the rest.
* if a condition is true/false in the almost all case, assume it is true/false.
* assume there's no tag jump occurs, delete all codes relating to tag.



If things are done until this,
it becomes very shorter.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_yield_0()` (simplified)</p>

<pre class="longlist">
static VALUE
rb_yield_0(val, self, klass, /* pcall=0 */)
    VALUE val, self, klass;
{
    volatile VALUE result = Qnil;
    volatile VALUE old_cref;
    volatile VALUE old_wrapper;
    struct BLOCK * volatile block;
    struct SCOPE * volatile old_scope;
    struct FRAME frame;
    int state;

    PUSH_VARS();
    PUSH_CLASS();
    block = ruby_block;
    frame = block->frame;
    frame.prev = ruby_frame;
    ruby_frame = &(frame);
    old_cref = (VALUE)ruby_cref;
    ruby_cref = (NODE*)ruby_frame->cbase;
    old_wrapper = ruby_wrapper;
    ruby_wrapper = block->wrapper;
    old_scope = ruby_scope;
    ruby_scope = block->scope;
    ruby_block = block->prev;
    ruby_dyna_vars = new_dvar(0, 0, block->dyna_vars);
    ruby_class = block->klass;
    self = block->self;

    /* set the block arguments */
    massign(self, block->var, val, pcall);

    PUSH_ITER(block->iter);
    /* execute the block body */
    result = rb_eval(self, block->body);
    POP_ITER();

    POP_CLASS();
    /* ……collect ruby_dyna_vars…… */
    POP_VARS();
    ruby_block = block;
    ruby_frame = ruby_frame->prev;
    ruby_cref = (NODE*)old_cref;
    ruby_wrapper = old_wrapper;
    ruby_scope = old_scope;

    return result;
}
</pre>


As you can see, the most stack frames are replaced with what saved at `ruby_block`.
Things to simple save/restore are easy to understand,
so let's see the handling of the other frames we need to be careful about.


h4. `FRAME`



<pre class="emlist">
struct FRAME frame;

frame = block->frame;     /* copy the entire struct */
frame.prev = ruby_frame;  /* by these two lines…… */
ruby_frame = &(frame);    /* ……frame is pushed */
</pre>


Differing from the other frames, a `FRAME` is not used in the saved state,
but a new `FRAME` is created by duplicating.
This would look like Figure 3.


<div class="image">
<img src="images/ch_iterator_framepush.jpg" alt="(framepush)"><br>
Figure 3: push a copied frame
* コピーして作る creating by copying
</div>


As we've seen the code until here,
it seems that `FRAME` will never be "reused".
When pushing `FRAME`, a new `FRAME` will always be created.




h4. `BLOCK`



<pre class="emlist">
block = ruby_block;
         ：
ruby_block = block->prev;
         ：
ruby_block = block;
</pre>



What is the most mysterious is this behavior of `BLOCK`.
We can't easily understand whether it is saving or popping.
It's comprehensible that the first statement and the third statement are as a pair,
and the state will be eventually back.
However, what is the consequence of the second statement?


To put the consequence of I've pondered a lot in one phrase,
"going back to the `ruby_block` of at the moment when pushing the block".
An iterator is, in short, the syntax to go back to the previous frame.
Therefore, all we have to do is turning the state of the stack frame into what
was at the moment when creating the block.
And, the value of `ruby_block` at the moment when creating the block is,
it seems certain that it was `block->prev`.
Therefore, it is contained in `prev`.


Additionally, for the question "is it no problem to assume what invoked is
always the top of `ruby_block`?",
there's no choice but saying "as the `rb_yield_0` side, you can assume so".
To push the block which should be invoked on the top of the `ruby_block` is the
work of the side to prepare the block,
and not the work of `rb_yield_0`.


An example of it is `BEGIN_CALLARGS` which was discussed in the previous chapter.
When an iterator call cascades, the two blocks are pushed and the top of the
stack will be the block which should not be used.
Therefore, it is purposefully checked and set aside.




h4. `VARS`


Come to think of it,
I think we have not looked the contents of `PUSH_VARS()` and `POP_VARS()` yet.
Let's see them here.


<p class="caption">▼ `PUSH_VARS() POP_VARS()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 619  #define PUSH_VARS() do { \
 620      struct RVarmap * volatile _old; \
 621      _old = ruby_dyna_vars;          \
 622      ruby_dyna_vars = 0

 624  #define POP_VARS() \
 625     if (_old && (ruby_scope->flags & SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE)) {   \
 626         if (RBASIC(_old)->flags) /* if were not recycled */ \
 627             FL_SET(_old, DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE);                  \
 628      }                                                        \
 629      ruby_dyna_vars = _old;                                   \
 630  } while (0)

(eval.c)
</pre>


This is also not pushing a new struct, to say "set aside/restore" is closer.
In practice, in `rb_yield_0`, `PUSH_VARS()` is used only to set aside the value.
What actually prepares `ruby_dyna_vars` is this line.



<pre class="emlist">
ruby_dyna_vars = new_dvar(0, 0, block->dyna_vars);
</pre>


This takes the `dyna_vars` saved in `BLOCK` and sets it.
An entry is attached at the same time.
I'd like you to recall the description of the structure of `ruby_dyna_vars` in Part 2,
it said the `RVarmap` whose `id` is 0 such as the one created here is used as
the break between block scopes.


However, in fact, between the parser and the evaluator, the form of the link
stored in `ruby_dyna_vars` is slightly different.
Let's look at the `dvar_asgn_curr()` function, which assigns a block local
variable at the current block.


<p class="caption">▼ `dvar_asgn_curr()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 737  static inline void
 738  dvar_asgn_curr(id, value)
 739      ID id;
 740      VALUE value;
 741  {
 742      dvar_asgn_internal(id, value, 1);
 743  }

 699  static void
 700  dvar_asgn_internal(id, value, curr)
 701      ID id;
 702      VALUE value;
 703      int curr;
 704  {
 705      int n = 0;
 706      struct RVarmap *vars = ruby_dyna_vars;
 707
 708      while (vars) {
 709          if (curr && vars->id == 0) {
 710              /* first null is a dvar header */
 711              n++;
 712              if (n == 2) break;
 713          }
 714          if (vars->id == id) {
 715              vars->val = value;
 716              return;
 717          }
 718          vars = vars->next;
 719      }
 720      if (!ruby_dyna_vars) {
 721          ruby_dyna_vars = new_dvar(id, value, 0);
 722      }
 723      else {
 724          vars = new_dvar(id, value, ruby_dyna_vars->next);
 725          ruby_dyna_vars->next = vars;
 726      }
 727  }

(eval.c)
</pre>


The last `if` statement is to add a variable.
If we focus on there, we can see a link is always pushed in at the "next" to
`ruby_dyna_vars`. This means, it would look like Figure 4.


<div class="image">
<img src="images/ch_iterator_dynavarseval.jpg" alt="(dynavarseval)"><br>
Figure 4: the structure of `ruby_dyna_vars`

* ブロック起動直後 immediately after invoking a block
* ブロック変数を追加 add block variables
* 追加された変数 added variables
</div>


This differs from the case of the parser in one point:
the headers (id=0) to indicate the breaks of scopes are attached before the
links. If a header is attached after the links, the first one of the scope
cannot be inserted properly. (Figure 5)<br>
((errata: It was described that `ruby_dyna_vars` of the evaluator always forms
a single straight link.
But according to the errata, it was wrong. That part and relevant descriptions
are removed.))

</div>




h3. Target Specified Jump


The code relates to jump tags are omitted in the previously shown code,
but there's an effort that we've never seen before in the jump of `rb_yield_0`.
Why is the effort necessary?
I'll tell the reason in advance. I'd like you to see the below program:



<pre class="emlist">
[0].each do
  break
end
# the place to reach by break
</pre>


like this way, in the case when doing `break` from inside of a block,
it is necessary to get out of the block and go to the method that pushed the
block.
What does it actually mean?
Let's think by looking at the (dynamic) call graph when invoking an iterator.



<pre class="emlist">
rb_eval(NODE_ITER)                   .... catch(TAG_BREAK)
    rb_eval(NODE_CALL)               .... catch(TAG_BREAK)
        rb_eval(NODE_YIELD)
            rb_yield_0
                rb_eval(NODE_BREAK)  .... throw(TAG_BREAK)
</pre>


Since what pushed the block is `NODE_ITER`,
it should go back to a `NODE_ITER` when doing `break`.
However, `NODE_CALL` is waiting for `TAG_BREAK` before `NODE_ITER`,
in order to turn a `break` over methods into an error.
This is a problem. We need to somehow find a way to go straight back to a `NODE_ITER`.


And actually, "going back to a `NODE_ITER`" will still be a problem.
If iterators are nesting,
there could be multiple `NODE_ITER`s,
thus the one corresponds to the current block is not always the first `NODE_ITER`.
In other words, we need to restrict only "the `NODE_ITER` that pushed the
currently being invoked block"


Then, let's see how this is resolved.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_yield_0()` − the parts relates to tags</p>

<pre class="longlist">
3826      PUSH_TAG(PROT_NONE);
3827      if ((state = EXEC_TAG()) == 0) {

3838      }
3839      else {
3840          switch (state) {
3841            case TAG_REDO:
3842              state = 0;
3843              CHECK_INTS;
3844              goto redo;
3845            case TAG_NEXT:
3846              state = 0;
3847              result = prot_tag->retval;
3848              break;
3849            case TAG_BREAK:
3850            case TAG_RETURN:
3851              state |= (serial++ << 8);
3852              state |= 0x10;
3853              block->tag->dst = state;
3854              break;
3855            default:
3856              break;
3857          }
3858      }
3859      POP_TAG();

(eval.c)
</pre>


The parts of `TAG_BREAK` and `TAG_RETURN` are crucial.


First, `serial` is a static variable of `rb_yield_0()`,
its value will be different every time calling `rb_yield_0`.
"serial" is the serial of "serial number".


The reason why left shifting by 8 bits seems in order to avoid overlapping the
values of `TAG_xxxx`.
`TAG_xxxx` is in the range between `0x1` ~ `0x8`, 4 bits are enough.
And, the bit-or of `0x10` seems to prevent `serial` from overflow.
In 32-bit machine, `serial` can use only 24 bits (only 16 million times),
recent machine can let it overflow within less than 10 seconds.
If this happens, the top 24 bits become all 0 in line.
Therefore, if `0x10` did not exist, `state` would be the same value as `TAG_xxxx`
(See also Figure 6).


<div class="image">
<img src="images/ch_iterator_dst.jpg" alt="(dst)"><br>
Fig.6: <tt>block-&gt;tag-&gt;dst</tt>
* 常に１ always 1
</div>


Now, `tag->dst` became the value which differs from `TAG_xxxx` and is unique for each call.
In this situation, because an ordinary `switch` as previous ones cannot receive it,
the side to stop jumps should need efforts to some extent.
The place where making an effort is this place of `rb_eval:NODE_ITER`:


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_ITER`  (to stop jumps)</p>

<pre class="longlist">
case NODE_ITER:
  {
      state = EXEC_TAG();
      if (state == 0) {
          /* …… invoke an iterator …… */
      }
      else if (_block.tag->dst == state) {
          state &= TAG_MASK;
          if (state == TAG_RETURN || state == TAG_BREAK) {
              result = prot_tag->retval;
          }
      }
  }
</pre>


In corresponding `NODE_ITER` and `rb_yield_0`, `block` should point to the same thing,
so `tag->dst` which was set at `rb_yield_0` comes in here.
Because of this, only the corresponding `NODE_ITER` can properly stop the jump.




h3. Check of a block


Whether or not a currently being evaluated method is an iterator,
in other words, whether there's a block,
can be checked by `rb_block_given_p()`.
After reading the above all, we can tell its implementation.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_block_given_p()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
3726  int
3727  rb_block_given_p()
3728  {
3729      if (ruby_frame->iter && ruby_block)
3730          return Qtrue;
3731      return Qfalse;
3732  }

(eval.c)
</pre>


I think there's no problem. What I'd like to talk about this time is actually
another function to check, it is `rb_f_block_given_p()`.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_f_block_given_p()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
3740  static VALUE
3741  rb_f_block_given_p()
3742  {
3743      if (ruby_frame->prev && ruby_frame->prev->iter && ruby_block)
3744          return Qtrue;
3745      return Qfalse;
3746  }

(eval.c)
</pre>


This is the substance of Ruby's `block_given?`.
In comparison to `rb_block_given_p()`,
this is different in checking the `prev` of `ruby_frame`.
Why is this?


Thinking about the mechanism to push a block,
to check the current `ruby_frame` like `rb_block_given_p()` is right.
But when calling `block_given?` from Ruby-level,
since `block_given?` itself is a method,
an extra `FRAME` is pushed.
Hence, we need to check the previous one.




h2. `Proc`


To describe a `Proc` object from the viewpoint of implementing,
it is "a `BLOCK` which can be bring out to Ruby level".
Being able to bring out to Ruby level means having more latitude,
but it also means when and where it will be used becomes completely unpredictable.
Focusing on how the influence of this fact is, let's look at the implementation.


h3. `Proc` object creation


A `Proc` object is created with `Proc.new`.
Its substance is `proc_new()`.


<p class="caption">▼ `proc_new()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
6418  static VALUE
6419  proc_new(klass)
6420      VALUE klass;

6424      struct RVarmap *vars;
6425
6426      if (!rb_block_given_p() && !rb_f_block_given_p()) {
6427          rb_raise(rb_eArgError,
                "tried to create Proc object without a block");
6428      }
6429
          /* （A）allocate both struct RData and struct BLOCK */
6430      proc = Data_Make_Struct(klass, struct BLOCK,
                                  blk_mark, blk_free, data);

6434      data->wrapper = ruby_wrapper;
6435      data->iter = data->prev?Qtrue:Qfalse;
          /* （B）the essential initialization is finished by here */
6436      frame_dup(&data->frame);
6437      if (data->iter) {
6438          blk_copy_prev(data);
6439      }
6440      else {
6441          data->prev = 0;
6442      }
6443      data->flags |= BLOCK_DYNAMIC;
6444      data->tag->flags |= BLOCK_DYNAMIC;
6445
6446      for (p = data; p; p = p->prev) {
6447          for (vars = p->dyna_vars; vars; vars = vars->next) {
6448              if (FL_TEST(vars, DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE)) break;
6449              FL_SET(vars, DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE);
6450          }
6451      }
6452      scope_dup(data->scope);
6453      proc_save_safe_level(proc);
6454
6455      return proc;
6456  }

(eval.c)
</pre>


The creation of a `Proc` object itself is unexpectedly simple.
Between (A) and (B), a space for an `Proc` object is allocated and its
initialization completes.
`Data_Make_Struct()` is a simple macro that does both `malloc()` and
`Data_Wrap_Struct()` at the same time.


The problems exist after that:

* `frame_dup()`
* `blk_copy_prev()`
* `FL_SET(vars, DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE)`
* `scope_dup()`

These four have the same purposes. They are:


* move all of what were put on the machine stack to the heap.
* prevent from collecting even if after `POP`


Here, "all" means the all things including `prev`.
For the all stack frames pushed there, it duplicates each frame by
doing `malloc()` and copying.
`VARS` is usually forced to be collected by `rb_gc_force_recycle()` at the same moment of `POP`,
but this behavior is stopped by setting the `DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE` flag.
And so on. Really extreme things are done.


Why are these extreme things necessary? This is because, unlike iterator blocks,
a `Proc` can persist longer than the method that created it.
And the end of a method means the things allocated on the machine stack such as
`FRAME`, `ITER`, and `local_vars` of `SCOPE` are invalidated.
It's easy to predict what the consequence of using the invalidated memories.
(An example answer: it becomes troublesome).


I tried to contrive a way to at least use the same `FRAME` from multiple `Proc`,
but since there are the places such as `old_frame` where setting aside the
pointers to the local variables, it does not seem going well.
If it requires a lot efforts in anyway,
another effort, say, allocating all of them with `malloc()` from the frist place,
seems better to give it a try.


Anyway, I sentimentally think that it's surprising that it runs with that speed
even though doing these extreme things.
Indeed, it has become a good time.



h3. Floating Frame


Previously, I mentioned it just in one phrase "duplicate all frames",
but since that was unclear, let's look at more details.
The points are the next two:


* How to duplicate all
* Why all of them are duplicated


Then first, let's start with the summary of how each stack frame is saved.


|_. Frame |_. location |_. has `prev` pointer? |
| `FRAME` | stack | yes |
| `SCOPE` | stack | no |
| `local_tbl` | heap | |
| `local_vars` | stack | |
| `VARS` | heap | no |
| `BLOCK` | stack | yes |


`CLASS CREF ITER` are not necessary this time. Since `CLASS` is a general Ruby
object, `rb_gc_force_recycle()` is not called with it even by mistake (it's
impossible) and both `CREF` and `ITER` becomes unnecessary after storing its
values at the moment in `FRAME`.
The four frames in the above table are important
because these will be modified or referred to multiple times later.
The rest three will not.


Then, this talk moves to how to duplicate all.
I said "how", but it does not about such as "by `malloc()`".
The problem is how to duplicate "all".
It is because, here I'd like you to see the above table,
there are some frames without any `prev` pointer.
In other words, we cannot follow links.
In this situation, how can we duplicate all?


A fairly clever technique used to counter this.
Let's take `SCOPE` as an example.
A function named `scope_dup()` is used previously in order to duplicate `SCOPE`,
so let's see it first.


<p class="caption">▼ `scope_dup()`  only the beginning</p>

<pre class="longlist">
6187  static void
6188  scope_dup(scope)
6189      struct SCOPE *scope;
6190  {
6191      ID *tbl;
6192      VALUE *vars;
6193
6194      scope->flags |= SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE;

(eval.c)
</pre>


As you can see, `SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE` is set.
Then next, take a look at the definition of `POP_SCOPE()`:


<p class="caption">▼ `POP_SCOPE()`  only the beginning</p>

<pre class="longlist">
 869  #define POP_SCOPE()                                      \
 870      if (ruby_scope->flags & SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE) {        \
 871         if (_old) scope_dup(_old);                        \
 872      }                                                    \

(eval.c)
</pre>


When it pops, if `SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE` flag was set to the current `SCOPE` (`ruby_scope`),
it also does `scope_dup()` of the previous `SCOPE` (`_old`).
In other words, `SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE` is also set to this one.
In this way, one by one, the flag is propagated at the time when it pops.
(Figure 7)


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_iterator_flaginfect.jpg" alt="(flaginfect)"><br>
Figure 7: flag propagation
</p>


Since `VARS` also does not have any `prev` pointer,
the same technique is used to propagate the `DVAR_DONT_RECYCLE` flag.


Next, the second point, try to think about "why all of them are duplicated".
We can understand that the local variables of `SCOPE` can be referred to later
if its `Proc` is created.
However, is it necessary to copy all of them including the previous `SCOPE` in
order to accomplish that?


Honestly speaking, I couldn't find the answer of this question and has been
worried about how can I write this section for almost three days,
I've just got the answer. Take a look at the next program:



<pre class="emlist">
def get_proc
  Proc.new { nil }
end

env = get_proc { p 'ok' }
eval("yield", env)
</pre>


I have not explained this feature, but by passing a `Proc` object as the second
argument of `eval`, you can evaluate the string in that environment.


It means, as the readers who have read until here can probably tell, it pushes
the various environments taken from the `Proc` (meaning `BLOCK`) and evaluates.
In this case, it naturally also pushes `BLOCK` and
you can turn the `BLOCK` into a `Proc` again.
Then, using the `Proc` when doing `eval` ... if things are done like this, you
can access almost all information of `ruby_block` from Ruby level as you like.
This is the reason why the entire stacks need to be fully duplicated.
<br>((errata: we cannot access `ruby_block` as we like from Ruby level.
The reason why all `SCOPE`s are duplicated was not understood.
It seems all we can do is to investigate the mailing list archives of the time
when this change was applied. (It is still not certain whether we can find out
the reason in this way.)
<br>))


h3. Invocation of `Proc`


Next, we'll look at the invocation of a created `Proc`.
Since `Proc#call` can be used from Ruby to invoke,
we can follow the substance of it.


The substance of `Proc#call` is `proc_call()`:


<p class="caption">▼ `proc_call()` </p>

<pre class="longlist">
6570  static VALUE
6571  proc_call(proc, args)
6572      VALUE proc, args;           /* OK */
6573  {
6574      return proc_invoke(proc, args, Qtrue, Qundef);
6575  }

(eval.c)
</pre>


Delegate to `proc_invoke()`. When I look up `invoke` in a dictionary,
it was written such as "call on (God, etc.) for help",
but when it is in the context of programming,
it is often used in the almost same meaning as "activate".


The prototype of the `proc_invoke()` is,



<pre class="emlist">
proc_invoke(VALUE proc, VALUE args, int pcall, VALUE self)
</pre>


However, according to the previous code, `pcall=Qtrue` and `self=Qundef` in this case,
so these two can be removed by constant foldings.


<p class="caption">▼ `proc_invoke` (simplified)</p>

<pre class="longlist">

    VALUE proc, args;

    struct BLOCK *data;
    volatile VALUE result = Qnil;
    int state;
    volatile int orphan;
    volatile int safe = ruby_safe_level;
    volatile VALUE old_wrapper = ruby_wrapper;
    struct RVarmap * volatile old_dvars = ruby_dyna_vars;

    /*（A）take BLOCK from proc and assign it to data */
    Data_Get_Struct(proc, struct BLOCK, data);
    /*（B）blk_orphan */
    orphan = blk_orphan(data);

    ruby_wrapper = data->wrapper;
    ruby_dyna_vars = data->dyna_vars;
    /*（C）push BLOCK from data */
    old_block = ruby_block;
    _block = *data;
    ruby_block = &_block;

    /*（D）transition to ITER_CUR */
    PUSH_ITER(ITER_CUR);
    ruby_frame->iter = ITER_CUR;

    PUSH_TAG(PROT_NONE);
    state = EXEC_TAG();
    if (state == 0) {
        proc_set_safe_level(proc);
        /*（E）invoke the block */
        result = rb_yield_0(args, self, 0, pcall);
    }
    POP_TAG();

    POP_ITER();
    if (ruby_block->tag->dst == state) {
        state &= TAG_MASK;      /* target specified jump */
    }
    ruby_block = old_block;
    ruby_wrapper = old_wrapper;
    ruby_dyna_vars = old_dvars;
    ruby_safe_level = safe;

    switch (state) {
      case 0:
        break;
      case TAG_BREAK:
        result = prot_tag->retval;
        break;
      case TAG_RETURN:
        if (orphan) {   /* orphan procedure */
            localjump_error("return from proc-closure", prot_tag->retval);
        }
        /* fall through */
      default:
        JUMP_TAG(state);
    }
    return result;
}
</pre>



The crucial points are three: C, D, and E.


==(C)== At `NODE_ITER` a `BLOCK` is created from the syntax tree and pushed,
but this time, a `BLOCK` is taken from `Proc` and pushed.


(D) It was `ITER_PRE` before becoming `ITER_CUR` at `rb_call0()`,
but this time it goes directly into `ITER_CUR`.


(E) If the case was an ordinary iterator,
its method call exists before `yeild` occurs then going to `rb_yield_0`,
but this time `rb_yield_()` is directly called and invokes the just pushed block.


In other words, in the case of iterator, the procedures are separated into three places,
`NODE_ITER` ~ `rb_call0()` ~ `NODE_YIELD`. But this time, they are done all at once.


Finally, I'll talk about the meaning of `blk_orphan()`.
As the name suggests, it is a function to determine the state of "the method
which created the `Proc` has finished".
For example, the `SCOPE` used by a `BLOCK` has already been popped,
you can determine it has finished.




h3. Block and `Proc`


In the previous chapter, various things about arguments and parameters of
methods are discussed, but I have not described about block parameters yet.
Although it is brief, here I'll perform the final part of that series.



<pre class="emlist">
def m(&block)
end
</pre>


This is a "block parameter". The way to enable this is very simple.
If `m` is an iterator,
it is certain that a `BLOCK` was already pushed,
turn it into a `Proc` and assign into (in this case) the local variable `block`.
How to turn a block into a `Proc` is just calling `proc_new()`, which was previously described.
The reason why just calling is enough can be a little incomprehensible.
However whichever `Proc.new` or `m`,
the situation "a method is called and a `BLOCK` is pushed" is the same.
Therefore, from C level, anytime you can turn a block into a `Proc`
by just calling `proc_new()`.


And if `m` is not an iterator, all we have to do is simply assigning `nil`.


Next, it is the side to pass a block.



<pre class="emlist">
m(&block)
</pre>

This is a "block argument". This is also simple,
take a `BLOCK` from (a `Proc` object stored in) `block` and push it.
What differs from `PUSH_BLOCK()` is only whether a `BLOCK` has already been
created in advance or not.


The function to do this procedure is `block_pass()`.
If you are curious about, check and confirm around it.
However, it really does just only what was described here,
it's possible you'll be disappointed...
