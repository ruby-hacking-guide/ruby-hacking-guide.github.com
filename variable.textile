h1. Chapter 6: Variables and constants

h2. Outline of this chapter

h3. Ruby variables

In Ruby there are quite a lot of different types of variables and
constants. Let's line them up, starting from the largest scope.

* Global variables
* Constants
* Class variables
* Instance variables
* Local variables

Instance variables were already explained in chapter 2 "Objects". In
this chapter we'll talk about:

* Global variables
* Class variables
* Constants

We will talk about local variables in the third part of the book.

h3. API for variables

The object of this chapter's analysis is `variable.c`. Let's first
look at the available API.

<pre class="emlist">
VALUE rb_iv_get(VALUE obj, char *name)
VALUE rb_ivar_get(VALUE obj, ID name)
VALUE rb_iv_set(VALUE obj, char *name, VALUE val)
VALUE rb_ivar_set(VALUE obj, ID name, VALUE val)
</pre>

We've already spoken about those functions, but must mention them again
as they are in `variable.c`. They are of course used for accessing instance
variables.

<pre class="emlist">
VALUE rb_cv_get(VALUE klass, char *name)
VALUE rb_cvar_get(VALUE klass, ID name)
VALUE rb_cv_set(VALUE klass, char *name, VALUE val)
VALUE rb_cvar_set(VALUE klass, ID name, VALUE val)
</pre>

These functions are the API for accessing class variables. Class
variables belong directly to classes so the functions take a class as
parameter. There are in two groups, depending if their name starts
with `rb_Xv` or `rb_Xvar`. The difference lies in the type of the
variable "name". The ones with a shorter name are generally easier to
use because they take a `char*`. The ones with a longer name are more
for internal use as they take a `ID`.

<pre class="emlist">
VALUE rb_const_get(VALUE klass, ID name)
VALUE rb_const_get_at(VALUE klass, ID name)
VALUE rb_const_set(VALUE klass, ID name, VALUE val)
</pre>

These functions are for accessing constants. Constants also belong to
classes so they take classes as parameter. `rb_const_get()` follows
the superclass chain, whereas `rb_const_get_at()` does not (it just
looks in `klass`).

<pre class="emlist">
struct global_entry *rb_global_entry(ID name)
VALUE rb_gv_get(char *name)
VALUE rb_gvar_get(struct global_entry *ent)
VALUE rb_gv_set(char *name, VALUE val)
VALUE rb_gvar_set(struct global_entry *ent, VALUE val)
</pre>

These last functions are for accessing global variables.  They are a
little different from the others due to the use of `struct
global_entry`. We'll explain this while describing the implementation.

h3. Important points

The most important topic of this chapter is "Where and how are variables
stored?", in other words: data structures.

The second most important matter is how we search for the values. The scopes
of Ruby variables and constants are quite complicated because
variables and constants are sometimes inherited, sometimes looked for
outside of the local scope... To have a better understanding, you
should first try to guess from the behavior how it could be
implemented, then compare that with what is really done.

h2. Class variables

Class variables are variables that belong to classes. In Java or C++
they are called static variables. They can be accessed from both the
class or its instances. But "from an instance" or "from the class" is
information only available in the evaluator, and we do not have one
for the moment. So from the C level it's like having no access
range. We'll just focus on the way these variables are stored.

h3. Reading

The functions to get a class variable are `rb_cvar_get()` and
`rb_cv_get()`. The function with the longer name takes `ID` as
parameter and the one with the shorter one takes `char*`. Because the
one taking an `ID` seems closer to the internals, we'll look at it.

▼ `rb_cvar_get()`
<pre class="longlist">
1508  VALUE
1509  rb_cvar_get(klass, id)
1510      VALUE klass;
1511      ID id;
1512  {
1513      VALUE value;
1514      VALUE tmp;
1515
1516      tmp = klass;
1517      while (tmp) {
1518          if (RCLASS(tmp)->iv_tbl) {
1519              if (st_lookup(RCLASS(tmp)->iv_tbl,id,&value)) {
1520                  if (RTEST(ruby_verbose)) {
1521                      cvar_override_check(id, tmp);
1522                  }
1523                  return value;
1524              }
1525          }
1526          tmp = RCLASS(tmp)->super;
1527      }
1528
1529      rb_name_error(id,"uninitialized class variable %s in %s",
1530                    rb_id2name(id), rb_class2name(klass));
1531      return Qnil;                /* not reached */
1532  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

This function reads a class variable in `klass`.

Error management functions like `rb_raise()` can be simply ignored
like I said before. The `rb_name_error()` that appears this time is a
function for raising an exception, so it can be ignored for the same
reasons. In `ruby`, you can assume that all functions ending with
`_error` raise an exception.

After removing all this, we can see that while following the `klass`'s
superclass chain we only search in `iv_tbl`. At this point you should
say "What? `iv_tbl` is the instance variables table, isn't it?" As a
matter of fact, class variables are stored in the instance variable
table.

We can do this because when creating `ID`s, the whole name of the
variables is taken into account, including the prefix: `rb_intern()`
will return different `ID`s for "`@var`" and "`@@var`". At the Ruby
level, the variable type is determined only by the prefix so there's
no way to access a class variable called `@var` from Ruby.

h2. Constants

It's a little abrupt but I'd like you to remember the members of
`struct RClass`. If we exclude the `basic` member, `struct RClass`
contains:

* `VALUE super`
* `struct st_table *iv_tbl`
* `struct st_table *m_tbl`

Then, considering that:

# constants belong to a class
# we can't see any table dedicated to constants in `struct RClass`
# class variables and instance variables are both in `iv_tbl`

Could it mean that the constants are also...

h3. Assignment

`rb_const_set()` is a function to set the value of constants: it sets
the constant `id` in the class `klass` to the value `val`.

▼ `rb_const_set()`
<pre class="longlist">
1377  void
1378  rb_const_set(klass, id, val)
1379      VALUE klass;
1380      ID id;
1381      VALUE val;
1382  {
1383      mod_av_set(klass, id, val, Qtrue);
1384  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

`mod_av_set()` does all the hard work:

▼ `mod_av_set()`
<pre class="longlist">
1352  static void
1353  mod_av_set(klass, id, val, isconst)
1354      VALUE klass;
1355      ID id;
1356      VALUE val;
1357      int isconst;
1358  {
1359      char *dest = isconst ? "constant" : "class variable";
1360
1361      if (!OBJ_TAINTED(klass) && rb_safe_level() >= 4)
1362          rb_raise(rb_eSecurityError, "Insecure: can't set %s", dest);
1363      if (OBJ_FROZEN(klass)) rb_error_frozen("class/module");
1364      if (!RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl) {
1365          RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl = st_init_numtable();
1366      }
1367      else if (isconst) {
1368          if (st_lookup(RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl, id, 0) ||
1369              (klass == rb_cObject && st_lookup(rb_class_tbl, id, 0))) {
1370              rb_warn("already initialized %s %s", dest, rb_id2name(id));
1371          }
1372      }
1373
1374      st_insert(RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl, id, val);
1375  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

You can this time again ignore the warning checks (`rb_raise()`,
`rb_error_frozen()` and `rb_warn()`). Here's what's left:

▼ `mod_av_set()` (only the important part)
<pre class="longlist">
    if (!RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl) {
        RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl = st_init_numtable();
    }
    st_insert(RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl, id, val);
</pre>

We're now sure constants also reside in the instance table. It means
in the `iv_tbl` of `struct RClass`, the following are mixed together:

# the class's own instance variables
# class variables
# constants

h3. Reading

We now know how the constants are stored. We'll now check how they
really work.

h4. `rb_const_get()`

We'll now look at `rconst_get()`, the function to read a
constant. This functions returns the constant referred to by `id` from the class
`klass`.

▼ `rb_const_get()`
<pre class="longlist">
1156  VALUE
1157  rb_const_get(klass, id)
1158      VALUE klass;
1159      ID id;
1160  {
1161      VALUE value, tmp;
1162      int mod_retry = 0;
1163
1164      tmp = klass;
1165    retry:
1166      while (tmp) {
1167          if (RCLASS(tmp)->iv_tbl &&
                  st_lookup(RCLASS(tmp)->iv_tbl,id,&value)) {
1168              return value;
1169          }
1170          if (tmp == rb_cObject && top_const_get(id, &value))
                  return value;
1171          tmp = RCLASS(tmp)->super;
1172      }
1173      if (!mod_retry && BUILTIN_TYPE(klass) == T_MODULE) {
1174          mod_retry = 1;
1175          tmp = rb_cObject;
1176          goto retry;
1177      }
1178
1179      /* Uninitialized constant */
1180      if (klass && klass != rb_cObject) {
1181          rb_name_error(id, "uninitialized constant %s at %s",
1182                        rb_id2name(id),
1183                        RSTRING(rb_class_path(klass))->ptr);
1184      }
1185      else { /* global_uninitialized */
1186          rb_name_error(id, "uninitialized constant %s",rb_id2name(id));
1187      }
1188      return Qnil;                /* not reached */
1189  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

There's a lot of code in the way. First, we should at least remove the
`rb_name_error()` in the second half. In the middle, what's around
`mod_entry` seems to be a special handling for modules. Let's also
remove that for the time being. The function gets reduced to this:

▼ `rb_const_get` (simplified)
<pre class="longlist">
VALUE
rb_const_get(klass, id)
    VALUE klass;
    ID id;
{
    VALUE value, tmp;

    tmp = klass;
    while (tmp) {
        if (RCLASS(tmp)->iv_tbl && st_lookup(RCLASS(tmp)->iv_tbl,id,&value)) {
            return value;
        }
        if (tmp == rb_cObject && top_const_get(id, &value)) return value;
        tmp = RCLASS(tmp)->super;
    }
}
</pre>

Now it should be pretty easy to understand. The function searches for the
constant in `iv_tbl` while climbing `klass`'s superclass chain. That
means:

<pre class="emlist">
class A
  Const = "ok"
end
class B < A
  p(Const)    # can be accessed
end
</pre>

The only problem remaining is `top_const_get()`. This function is only
called for `rb_cObject` so `top` must mean "top-level". If you don't
remember, at the top-level, the class is `Object`. This means the same
as "in the class statement defining `C`, the class becomes `C`",
meaning that "the top-level's class is `Object`".

<pre class="emlist">
# the class of the top-level is Object
class A
  # the class is A
  class B
    # the class is B
  end
end
</pre>

So `top_const_get()` probably does something specific to the top
level.

h4. `top_const_get()`

Let's look at this `top_const_get` function. It looks up the `id`
constant writes the value in `klassp` and returns.

▼ `top_const_get()`
<pre class="longlist">
1102  static int
1103  top_const_get(id, klassp)
1104      ID id;
1105      VALUE *klassp;
1106  {
1107      /* pre-defined class */
1108      if (st_lookup(rb_class_tbl, id, klassp)) return Qtrue;
1109
1110      /* autoload */
1111      if (autoload_tbl && st_lookup(autoload_tbl, id, 0)) {
1112          rb_autoload_load(id);
1113          *klassp = rb_const_get(rb_cObject, id);
1114          return Qtrue;
1115      }
1116      return Qfalse;
1117  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

`rb_class_tbl` was already mentioned in chapter 4 "Classes and
modules". It's the table for storing the classes defined at the
top-level. Built-in classes like `String` or `Array` have for example
an entry in it. That's why we should not forget to search in this
table when looking for top-level constants.

The next block is related to autoloading. This allows us to automatically
load a library when accessing a top-level constant for the first
time. This can be used like this:

<pre class="emlist">
autoload(:VeryBigClass, "verybigclass")   # VeryBigClass is defined in it
</pre>

After this, when `VeryBigClass` is accessed for the first time, the
`verybigclass` library is loaded (with `require`). As long as
`VeryBigClass` is defined in the library, execution can continue smoothly. It's
an efficient approach, when a library is too big and a lot of time is spent on loading.

This autoload is processed by `rb_autoload_xxxx()`. We won't discuss
autoload further in this chapter because there will probably be a big
change in how it works soon (The way autoload works _did_ change in
1.8: autoloaded constants do not need to be defined at top-level
anymore).

h4. Other classes?

But where did the code for looking up constants in other classes end up?
After all, constants are first looked up in the outside classes, then
in the superclasses.

In fact, we do not yet have enough knowledge to look at that. The
outside classes change depending on the location in the program. In
other words it depends of the program context. So we need first to
understand how the internal state of the
evaluator is handled. Specifically, this search in other classes is done in the
`ev_const_get()` function of `eval.c`. We'll look at it and finish
with the constants in the third part of the book.

h2. Global variables

h3. General remarks

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere. Or put the other way
around, there is no need to restrict access to them. Because they are
not attached to any context, the table only has to be at one place, and
there's no need to do any check. Therefore implementation is very
simple.

But there is still quite a lot of code. The reason for this is that global
variables are quite different from normal variables. Functions like
the following are only available for global variables:

* you can "hook" access of global variables
* you can alias them with `alias`

Let's explain this simply.

h4. Aliases of variables

<pre class="emlist">
alias $newname $oldname
</pre>

After this, you can use `$newname` instead of `$oldname`. `alias` for
variables is mainly a counter-measure for "symbol variables". "symbol
variables" are variables inherited from Perl like `$=` or `$0`. `$=`
decides if during string comparison upper and lower case letters
should be differentiated. `$0` shows the name of the main Ruby
program. There are some other symbol variables but anyway as their
name is only one character long, they are difficult to remember for
people who don't know Perl. So, aliases were created to make them a little
easier to understand.

That said, currently symbol variables are not recommended, and are
moved one by one in singleton methods of suitable modules. The current
school of thought is that `$=` and others will be abolished in 2.0.

h4. Hooks

You can "hook" read and write of global variables.

Hooks can be also be set at the Ruby level, but I was thinking: why not
instead look at C level special variables for system use like
`$KCODE`? `$KCODE` is the variable containing the encoding the
interpreter currently uses to handle strings. It can only be set to
special values like `"EUC"` or `"UTF8"`. But this is too bothersome so
it can also be set it to `"e"` or `"u"`.

<pre class="emlist">
p($KCODE)      # "NONE" (default)
$KCODE = "e"
p($KCODE)      # "EUC"
$KCODE = "u"
p($KCODE)      # "UTF8"
</pre>

Knowing that you can hook assignment of global variables, you should
understand easily how this can be done. By the way, `$KCODE`'s K comes
from "kanji" (the name of Chinese characters in Japanese).

You might say that even with `alias` or hooks,
global variables just aren't used much, so it's functionality that doesn't
really mater. It's adequate not to talk much about unused
functions, and I need some pages for the analysis of the parser and
evaluator. That's why I'll proceed with the explanation below throwing
away what's not really important.

h3. Data structure

When we were looking at how variables work, I said that the way they
are stored is important. That's why I'd like you to firmly grasp the
structure used by global variables.

▼ Data structure for global variables
<pre class="longlist">
  21  static st_table *rb_global_tbl;

 334  struct global_entry {
 335      struct global_variable *var;
 336      ID id;
 337  };

 324  struct global_variable {
 325      int   counter;      /* reference counter */
 326      void *data;         /* value of the variable */
 327      VALUE (*getter)();  /* function to get the variable */
 328      void  (*setter)();  /* function to set the variable */
 329      void  (*marker)();  /* function to mark the variable */
 330      int block_trace;
 331      struct trace_var *trace;
 332  };

(variable.c)
</pre>

`rb_global_tbl` is the main table. All global variables are stored in
this table. The keys of this table are of course variable names
(`ID`). A value is expressed by a `struct global_entry` and a `struct
global_variable` (figure 1).

!images/ch_variable_gvar.png(Global variables table at execution time)!

The structure representing the variables is split in two to be able to
create `alias`es. When an `alias` is established, two `global_entry`s
point to the same `struct global_variable`.

It's at this time that the reference counter (the `counter` member of
`struct global_variable`) is necessary. I explained the general idea of
a reference counter in the previous section "Garbage
collection". Reviewing it briefly, when a new reference to the
structure is made, the counter in incremented by 1. When the reference
is not used anymore, the counter is decreased by 1. When the counter
reaches 0, the structure is no longer useful so `free()` can be
called.

When hooks are set at the Ruby level, a list of `struct trace_var`s is
stored in the `trace` member of `struct global_variable`, but I won't
talk about it, and omit `struct trace_var`.

h3. Reading

You can have a general understanding of global variables just by looking at how
they are read. The functions for reading them are `rb_gv_get()` and
`rb_gvar_get()`.

▼ `rb_gv_get() rb_gvar_get()`
<pre class="longlist">
 716  VALUE
 717  rb_gv_get(name)
 718      const char *name;
 719  {
 720      struct global_entry *entry;
 721
 722      entry = rb_global_entry(global_id(name));
 723      return rb_gvar_get(entry);
 724  }

 649  VALUE
 650  rb_gvar_get(entry)
 651      struct global_entry *entry;
 652  {
 653      struct global_variable *var = entry->var;
 654      return (*var->getter)(entry->id, var->data, var);
 655  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

A substantial part of the content seems to turn around the
`rb_global_entry()` function, but that does not prevent us
understanding what's going on. `global_id` is a function that converts a
`char*` to `ID` and checks if it's the `ID` of a global
variable. `(*var->getter)(...)` is of course a function call using the
function pointer `var->getter`. If `p` is a function pointer,
`(*p)(arg)` calls the function.

But the main part is still `rb_global_entry()`.

▼ `rb_global_entry()`
<pre class="longlist">
 351  struct global_entry*
 352  rb_global_entry(id)
 353      ID id;
 354  {
 355      struct global_entry *entry;
 356
 357      if (!st_lookup(rb_global_tbl, id, &entry)) {
 358          struct global_variable *var;
 359          entry = ALLOC(struct global_entry);
 360          st_add_direct(rb_global_tbl, id, entry);
 361          var = ALLOC(struct global_variable);
 362          entry->id = id;
 363          entry->var = var;
 364          var->counter = 1;
 365          var->data = 0;
 366          var->getter = undef_getter;
 367          var->setter = undef_setter;
 368          var->marker = undef_marker;
 369
 370          var->block_trace = 0;
 371          var->trace = 0;
 372      }
 373      return entry;
 374  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

The main treatment is only done by the `st_lookup()` at the beginning.
What's done afterwards is just creating (and storing) a new entry. As, when
accessing a non existing global variable, an entry is automatically
created, `rb_global_entry()` will never return NULL.

This was mainly done for speed. When the parser finds a global
variable, it gets the corresponding `struct global_entry`. When
reading the value of the variable, the parser just has to get the
value from the entry (using `rb_gv_get()`), and has no need to do any
check.

Let's now continue a little with the code that follows. `var->getter`
and others are set to `undef_xxxx`. `undef` means that the global
`setter/getter/marker` for the variable are currently undefined.

`undef_getter()` just shows a warning and returns `nil`, as even
undefined global variables can be read. `undef_setter()` is quite
interesting so let's look at it.

▼ `undef_setter()`
<pre class="longlist">
 385  static void
 386  undef_setter(val, id, data, var)
 387      VALUE val;
 388      ID id;
 389      void *data;
 390      struct global_variable *var;
 391  {
 392      var->getter = val_getter;
 393      var->setter = val_setter;
 394      var->marker = val_marker;
 395
 396      var->data = (void*)val;
 397  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

`val_getter()` takes the value from `entry->data` and returns
it. `val_getter()` just puts a value in `entry->data`. Setting
handlers this way allows us not to need special handling for undefined
variables (figure 2). Skillfully done, isn't it?
