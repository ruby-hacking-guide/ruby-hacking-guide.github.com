<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<h2>A Minimal Introdution to Ruby</h2>
<p>Here the Ruby prerequisites are explained, which one needs to know
in order to understand the first section.
I won&#8217;t point out programming techniques or points one should be
careful about. So don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be able to write Ruby programs just because
you read this chapter. Readers who have prior experience with Ruby
can skip this chapter.</p>
<p>We will talk about grammar extensively in the second section, hence
I won&#8217;t delve into the finer points of grammar here. From hash literals
and such I&#8217;ll show only the most widely used notations. On principle
I won&#8217;t omit things even if I can. This way the syntax becomes more simple.
I won&#8217;t always say &#8220;We can omit this&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>Everything that can be manipulated in a Ruby program is an object.
There are no primitives as Java&#8217;s <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>. For instance
if we write as below it denotes a string object with content <code>content</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
"content"
</pre>
<p>I casually called it a  string object but to be precise this is an expression which generates
a string object. Therefore if we write it several times each time
another string object is generated.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
"content"
"content"
"content"
</pre>
<p>Here three string objects with content <code>content</code> are generated.</p>
<p>Besides, a program won&#8217;t do any good without some output. Let&#8217;s show how to print on the terminal.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p("content")   # Shows "content"
</pre>
<p>Everything after an <code>#</code> is a comment. From now on, I&#8217;ll put the result
of an expression in a comment behind.</p>
<p><code>p(</code>……<code>)</code> calls the function <code>p</code>. It displays arbitrary objects &#8220;as such&#8221;.
It&#8217;s basically a debugging function.</p>
<p>Precisely speaking, there are no functions in Ruby, but just for now
we can think of it as a function.</p>
<h3>Various Literals</h3>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s explain some more the expressions which directly generate objects,
the so-called literals.
First the integers and floating point numbers.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
# Integer
1
2
100
9999999999999999999999999   # Arbitrarily big integers

# Float
1.0
99.999
1.3e4     # 1.3×10^4
</pre>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that these are all expressions which generate objects.
I&#8217;m repeating myself but there are no primitives in Ruby.</p>
<p>Below an array object is generated.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
[1, 2, 3]
</pre>
<p>This program generates an array which consists of the three integers
1, 2 and 3 in that order. As the elements of an array can be arbitrary
objects the following is also possible.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
[1, "string", 2, ["nested", "array"]]
</pre>
<p>And finally, a hash table is generated by the expression below.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
{"key"=&gt;"value", "key2"=&gt;"value2", "key3"=&gt;"value3"}
</pre>
<p>A hash table is a structure which establishes a one-on-one relation between pairs of
arbitrary objects. The above line creates a table which stores the following table.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
"key"   →  "value"
"key2"  →  "value2"
"key3"  →  "value3"
</pre>
<p>If we ask the hash table above &#8220;What&#8217;s corresponding to <code>key</code>?&#8221;, it&#8217;ll
answer &#8220;That&#8217;s <code>value</code>.&#8221; How can we ask? We use methods.</p>
<h3>Method Calls</h3>
<p>We can call methods on an object. In C++ Jargon they are member functions.
I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary to explain what a method is. I&#8217;ll just explain
the notation.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
"content".upcase()
</pre>
<p>Here the <code>upcase</code> method is called on a string object ( with content <code>content</code>).
As <code>upcase</code> is a method which
returns a new string with the small letters replaced by capital letters
we get the following result.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p("content".upcase())   # Shows "CONTENT"
</pre>
<p>Method calls can be chained.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
"content".upcase().downcase()
</pre>
<p>Here the method <code>downcase</code> is called on the return value of <code>"content".upcase()</code>.</p>
<p>There are no public fields (member variables) as in Java or C++ (Note: need to check this). The object interface consists of methods only.</p>
<h2>The Program</h2>
<h3>Top Level</h3>
<p>In Ruby we can just write expressions and it becomes a program.
One doesn&#8217;t need to define a <code>main()</code> as in C++ or Java.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p("content")
</pre>
<p>This is a complete Ruby program. If we put this into a file called
<code>first.rb</code> we can execute it from the command line as follows.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby first.rb
"content"
</pre>
<p>With the <code>-e</code> option of the <code>ruby</code> program we don&#8217;t even need to create a file.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby -e 'p("content")'
"content"
</pre>
<p>By the way, the place where <code>p</code> is written is the lowest level of the program,
or the highest level from the program&#8217;s standpoint. Hence it&#8217;s called the
<em>toplevel</em>.
The existence of a toplevel is a characteristic trait of a scripting language.</p>
<p>In Ruby, one line is usually one statement. A semicolon at the end isn&#8217;t necessary.
Therefore the program below is interpreted as three statements.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p("content")
p("content".upcase())
p("CONTENT".downcase())
</pre>
<p>When we execute it it looks like this.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby second.rb
"content"
"CONTENT"
"content"
</pre>
<h3>Local Variables</h3>
<p>In Ruby all variables and constants store references to objects.
That&#8217;s why one can&#8217;t copy the content by assigning one variable to another variable.
Think of object type variables in Java or pointers in C++. But you can&#8217;t change the value
of these pointers.</p>
<p>In Ruby one can tell the scope of a variable by its name&#8217;s first letter.
Local variables start with a small letter or an underscore. One can write
an &#8220;=&#8221; for variable assignment.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
str = "content"
arr = [1,2,3]
</pre>
<p>An initial assignment serves as declaration, an explicit declaration is
not necessary. Because variables don&#8217;t have a type we can assign any type without
distinction. The program below is completely legal.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
lvar = "content"
lvar = [1,2,3]
lvar = 1
</pre>
<p>But just because we can we shouldn&#8217;t necessarily do it. If different
objects are put in one variable it tends to become difficult to read. In a
real world Ruby program one  doesn&#8217;t do this kind of things without a good reason.
The above was just an example for the sake of it.</p>
<p>Variable reference has also a pretty straightforward notation.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
str = "content"
p(str)           # Shows "content"
</pre>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at how a variable stores a reference.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
a = "content"
b = a
c = b
</pre>
<p>After we execute this program all three local variables <code>a b c</code>
point to the same object, a string object with content <code>"content"</code></p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_reference.jpg" alt="(reference)"><br>
Figure 1: Ruby variables store references to objects</p>
</p>
<p>Besides, these variables are called local. Hence there should be a scope
but we cannot talk about this scope without reading a bit further.
Let&#8217;s say for now that the top level is one local scope.</p>
<h3>Constants</h3>
<p>Constants start with a capital letter. They can only be assigned
once (at their creation).</p>
<pre class="emlist">
Const = "content"
PI = 3.1415926535

p(Const)   # Shows "content"
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say that if we assign twice an error occurs. But there
is just a warning, not an error. That&#8217;s because of applications
which use Ruby, for instance development environments. There shouldn&#8217;t
be an error when they load the same file twice. I recognize that
it had to be that way for practicality but there really should be an error.
Up until version 1.1 there really was an error.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
C = 1
C = 2   # There is a warning but ideally there should be an error.
</pre>
<p>A lot of people are fooled by the word constant.
A constant only does not switch objects once it is assigned.
But the object itself might as well change. The term &#8220;read only&#8221;
might capture the concept better than &#8220;constant&#8221;.</p>
<p>By the way, to indicate that an object itself shouldn&#8217;t be changed
another means is used: <code>freeze</code>.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_const.jpg" alt="(const)"><br>
Figure 2: constant means read only</p>
</p>
<p>And we cannot talk about the scope yet. We talk about it later in
the context of classes.</p>
<h3>Control Structures</h3>
<p>Unfortunately Ruby has a wide abundance of control structures.
For the time being we pretend there are just <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
if i &lt; 10 then
  # body
end

while i &lt; 10 do
  # body
end
</pre>
<p>Only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are false in a conditional expression, all
other various objects are true. 0 or the empty string are also true of course.</p>
<p>By the way, it wouldn&#8217;t be wise if there were just <code>false</code>, there is also <code>true</code>.
And it is of course true.</p>
<h2>Classes and Methods</h2>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>In object orientation methods belong to objects, in a perfect
world, though. But in a normal program there are a lot of objects which have the
same set of methods. Usually a mechanism like classes or
multimethods is used to get rid of the duplication of definitions.</p>
<p>In Ruby the traditional concept of classes is used to bind objects and
methods together. Namely every object belongs to a class, the methods
which can be called are determined by the class. Hence a method is
called an instance of a class.</p>
<p>For example the string <code>"str"</code> is called an instance of the class <code>String</code>.
And in this class <code>String</code> the methods <code>upcase</code>, <code>downcase</code>, <code>strip</code> and
many others are defined. So it looks as if each string object has all these
methods.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
# They all belong to the String class,
# hence the same methods are defined
       "content".upcase()
"This is a pen.".upcase()
    "chapter II".upcase()

       "content".length()
"This is a pen.".length()
    "chapter II".length()
</pre>
<p>By the way, what happens if the called method isn&#8217;t defined?
In a static language a compiler error occurs but in Ruby there
is a runtime exception. Let&#8217;s try it out. For this kind of programs the
<code>-e</code> option is handy.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby -e '"str".bad_method()'
-e:1: undefined method `bad_method' for "str":String (NoMethodError)
</pre>
<p>When the method isn&#8217;t found there&#8217;s apparently a <code>NoMethodError</code>.</p>
<p>Always talking about &#8220;the upcase method of String&#8221; and such is cumbersome.
Let&#8217;s introduce a special notation <code>String#upcase</code> refers to the method
<code>upcase</code> defined in the class <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>By the way, if we write <code>String.upcase</code> it has a completely different
meaning in the Ruby world. What could that be? I explain it in the
next paragraph.</p>
<h3>Class Definition</h3>
<p>Up to now we talked about already defined classes.
We can of course also define our own classes.
To define classes we use the word <code>class</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
end
</pre>
<p>This is the definition of a new class <code>C</code>. After we defined it we
can use it as follows.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
end
c = C.new()   # create an instance of C and assign it to the variable c
</pre>
<p>Note that the notation for creating a new instance is not <code>new C</code>.
The astute reader might think:
Hmm, this <code>C.new()</code> really looks like a method call.
In Ruby the object generating expressions are indeed just methods.</p>
<p>In Ruby class names and constant names are the same. But what is
contained in a class name, where there&#8217;s a constant with the same name? It&#8217;s the class.
In Ruby all things which a program can manipulate are objects. So
of course classes are also expressed as objects. Let&#8217;s call these
<em>class objects</em>. Every class is an instance of the class <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>In other words a <code>class</code> statement creates a new class object and
it assigns a constant named
with the classname to the class. On the other hand
the generation of an instance references this constant and calls a method
on this object ( usually new). If we look at the example below, it&#8217;s
pretty obvious that the creation of an instance doesn&#8217;t differ
from a normal method call.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
S = "content"
class C
end

S.upcase()  # Get the object the constant S points to and call upcase
C.new()     # Get the object the constant C points to and call new
</pre>
<p>So <code>new</code> is not a keyword in Ruby.</p>
<p>And we can also use <code>p</code> for an instance of a created class.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
end

c = C.new()
p(c)       # #&lt;C:0x2acbd7e4&gt;
</pre>
<p>It won&#8217;t display as nicely as a string or an integer but it shows
its respective class and it&#8217;s internal ID. This ID is the pointer value
which points to the object.</p>
<p>Oh, I completely forgot but about the notation of method names:
<code>Object.new</code> calls the method <code>new</code> of the class object <code>Object</code> itself.
So <code>Object#new</code> and <code>Object.new</code> are completely different things, we have
to separate them strictly.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
obj = Object.new()   # Object.new
obj.new()            # Object#new
</pre>
<p>In practice a method <code>Object#new</code> is almost never defined so the
second line will return an error. Please keep this example in mind.</p>
<h3>Method Definition</h3>
<p>If we can define classes we should also be able to define methods.
Let&#8217;s define a method for our class <code>C</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def myupcase( str )
    return str.upcase()
  end
end
</pre>
<p>To define a method we use the word <code>def</code>. In this example we
defined the method <code>myupcase</code>. The name of the only parameter is <code>str</code>.
As with variables it&#8217;s not necessary to write down the type of the parameter.
And we can use any number of parameters.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use the defined method. Methods are usually called from the
outside.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
c = C.new()
result = c.myupcase("content")
p(result)   # Shows "CONTENT"
</pre>
<p>Of course if you get used to it you don&#8217;t need to assign everything.
The line below gives the same result.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(C.new().myupcase("content"))   # Also shows "CONTENT"
</pre>
<h3><code>self</code></h3>
<p>During the execution of a method the information about itself (the instance
which called the method) is saved and can be picked up in <code>self</code>.
Like the <code>this</code> in C++ or Java. Let&#8217;s check this out.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def get_self()
    return self
  end
end

c = C.new()
p(c)              # #&lt;C:0x40274e44&gt;
p(c.get_self())   # #&lt;C:0x40274e44&gt;
</pre>
<p>As we see, the exact same object is returned.
We ascertained that for the called method <code>self</code> is <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>How should a method against oneself be called?
It comes to mind to do this also via <code>self</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def my_p( obj )
    self.real_my_p(obj)   # called a method against oneself
  end

  def real_my_p( obj )
    p(obj)
  end
end

C.new().my_p(1)   # Output 1
</pre>
<p>But always adding the <code>self</code> when calling an own method is tedious.
Hence, whenever one calls <code>self</code> one can omit the called object ( the receiver) by convention.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def my_p( obj )
    real_my_p(obj)   # Calling without writing down the receiver.
  end

  def real_my_p( obj )
    p(obj)
  end
end

C.new().my_p(1)   # Output 1
</pre>
<h3>Instance Variables</h3>
<p>The saying goes &#8220;Objects are data and code&#8221;. So the definition
of methods alone would be useless. Objects must also be able
to store data. In other words instance variables.
Or in C++ jargon member variables. (Note: Check this.)</p>
<p>In the fashion of Ruby&#8217;s variable naming convention, the first
letter determines the variable type. For instance variables it&#8217;s
an <code>@</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def set_i(value)
    @i = value
  end

  def get_i()
    return @i
  end
end

c = C.new()
c.set_i("ok")
p(c.get_i())   # Shows "ok"
</pre>
<p>Instance variables differ a bit from the variables seen before:
We can reference them without assigning or defining them.
To see what happens we add the following lines to the code above.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
c = C.new()
p(c.get_i())   # Shows nil
</pre>
<p>Calling <code>get</code> without <code>set</code> gives <code>nil</code>. <code>nil</code> is the object
which indicates &#8220;nothing&#8221;. It&#8217;s mysterious why there&#8217;s an object
where there should be nothing, but that&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>We can use <code>nil</code> like a literal as well.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(nil)   # Shows nil
</pre>
<h3><code>initialize</code></h3>
<p>As we saw before, when we call &#8216;new&#8217; on a freshly defined class,
we can create an instance. That&#8217;s surely a good thing, but
sometimes we might want to have a peculiar instantiation.
In this case we don&#8217;t change method <code>new</code>, we change the method <code>initialize</code>.
When we do this it  get&#8217;s called within <code>new</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def initialize()
    @i = "ok"
  end
  def get_i()
    return @i
  end
end
c = C.new()
p(c.get_i())   # Shows "ok"
</pre>
<p>Strictly speaking this is the work of the <code>new</code> method not the
work of the language itself.</p>
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>Classes can inherit from other classes. For instance <code>String</code>
inherits from <code>Object</code>. In this text we&#8217;&#8217;ll indicate this relation
by a vertical arrow as in Fig.3.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_supersub.jpg" alt="(supersub)"><br>
Figure 3: Inheritance</p>
</p>
<p>In the illustration the inherited class (<code>Object</code>) is called
superclass or superior class. The inheriting class (<code>String</code>) is called
subclass or inferior class. This point differs from C++ jargon, be careful.
But it&#8217;s the same as in Java.</p>
<p>Anyway let&#8217;s try it out. Let&#8217;s inherit for our created class from another
class. To inherit from another class ( or designate a superclass)
write the following.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C &lt; SuperClassName
end
</pre>
<p>When we leave out the superclass like in the cases before the
class <code>Object</code> becomes tacitly the superclass.</p>
<p>Now, why should we want to inherit? Of course to hand over methods.
Handing over means that the methods which were defined in the
superclass also work in the subclass as if they were defined in there once more.
Let&#8217;s check it out.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def hello()
    return "hello"
  end
end

class Sub &lt; C
end

sub = Sub.new()
p(sub.hello())   # Shows "hello"
</pre>
<p><code>hello</code> was defined in the class <code>C</code> but we could call it from
the class <code>Sub</code> as well. Of course we don&#8217;t need to assign variables.
The above is the same as the line below.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(Sub.new().hello())
</pre>
<p>When we define a method with the same name we overwrite a method.
In C++ and Object Pascal (Delphi) it&#8217;s only possible to overwrite
explicitly with the keyword <code>virtual</code> but in Ruby every method
can be overwritten unconditionally.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  def hello()
    return "Hello"
  end
end

class Sub &lt; C
  def hello()
    return "Hello from Sub"
  end
end

p(Sub.new().hello())   # Shows "Hello from Sub"
p(C.new().hello())     # Shows "Hello"
</pre>
<p>We can inherit over several steps. For instance as in Fig.4
<code>Fixnum</code> inherits every method from <code>Object</code>, <code>Numeric</code> and <code>Integer</code>.
When there are methods with the same name the nearer classes take
preference. As type overloading isn&#8217;t there at all the requisites are
extremely straigtforward.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_multiinherit.jpg" alt="(multiinherit)"><br>
Figure 4: Inheitance over multiple steps</p>
</p>
<p>In C++ it&#8217;s possible to create a class which inherits nothing.
While in Ruby one has to inherit from the <code>Object</code> class either
directly or indirectly. In other words when we draw the inheritance
relations it becomes a single tree with <code>Object</code> at the top.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_classtree.jpg" alt="(classtree)"><br>
Figure 5: Ruby&#8217;s class tree</p>
</p>
<p>(Note: changed in 1.9: <code>Socket</code> isn&#8217;t builtin anymore, might want to add
<code>Fiber</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Symbol</code>)</p>
<p>When the superclass is appointed ( in the definition statement ) it&#8217;s
not possible to change it anymore. In other words, one can add to the class tree
but cannot change a position or delete a class.</p>
<h3>Inheritance of Variables……?</h3>
<p>In Ruby (instance) variables aren&#8217;t inherited.
Even when inheriting, there&#8217;s no information what variables that class
uses.</p>
<p>But when an inherited method is called ( in an instance of a subclass),
assignment of instance variables happens. Which means they
become defined. Then, since the namespace of instance variables
is completely flat, it can be accessed by whichever method.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class A
  def initialize()   # called from when processing new()
    @i = "ok"
  end
end

class B &lt; A
  def print_i()
    p(@i)
  end
end

B.new().print_i()   # Shows "ok"
</pre>
<p>If you can&#8217;t agree with this behavior let&#8217;s think more about classses
and inheritance. When there&#8217;s an instance <code>obj</code> of the
the class <code>C</code> then all the methods of the superclass of <code>C</code> are as if
defined in <code>C</code>. Of course we keep the overwrite rule in mind.
Then the methods of <code>C</code> get attached to the instance <code>obj</code> (Fig.6).
This strong palpability is a specialty of Ruby&#8217;s object orientation.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_objimage.jpg" alt="(objimage)"><br>
Figure 6: A conception of a Ruby object</p>
</p>
<p>(メソッド:method)</p>
<h3>Modules</h3>
<p>Only a single superclass can be designated. So Ruby looks like
single inheritance. But because of <em>modules</em> it has in practice
the same abilities as a multiple inheritance language.
Let&#8217;s explain these modules next.</p>
<p>In short, modules are classes for which a superclass cannot be
designated and instances cannot be created.
For the definition we write as follows.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module M
end
</pre>
<p>Here the module <code>M</code> was defined. Methods are defined exactly the
same way as for classes.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module M
  def myupcase( str )
    return str.upcase()
  end
end
</pre>
<p>But because instances cannot be directly created we cannot call
these directly. What can we do about it? We can use these methods
by including the module into other classes. When doing so it&#8217;s as if
the module inherits to the class.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module M
  def myupcase( str )
    return str.upcase()
  end
end

class C
  include M
end

p(C.new().myupcase("content"))  # "CONTENT" is shown
</pre>
<p>Even though no method was defined in the class <code>C</code> we can call
the method <code>myupcase</code>. It was inherited from the module <code>M</code>.
Inclusion is functionally completely the same as inheritance.
There&#8217;s no limit on the access of methods and instance variables.</p>
<p>A superclass cannot be assigned to a module, but
other modules can be included.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module M
end

module M2
  include M
end
</pre>
<p>In other words it&#8217;s functionally the same as appointing a superclass.
But a class cannot come above a module. Only modules are allowed
above modules.</p>
<p>The example below also contains the inheritance of methods.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module OneMore
  def method_OneMore()
    p("OneMore")
  end
end

module M
  include OneMore

  def method_M()
    p("M")
  end
end

class C
  include M
end

C.new().method_M()         # Output "M"
C.new().method_OneMore()   # Output "OneMore"
</pre>
<p>As with classes when we sketch inheritance it looks like Fig.7</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_modinherit.jpg" alt="(modinherit)"><br>
Figure 7: multilevel inheritance</p>
</p>
<p>Besides, the class <code>C</code> also has a superclass. What might be its
relationship with the included modules. For instance we could write
as follows.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
# modcls.rb

class Cls
  def test()
    return "class"
  end
end

module Mod
  def test()
    return "module"
  end
end

class C &lt; Cls
  include Mod
end

p(B.new().test())   # "class"? "module"?
</pre>
<p><code>C</code> inherits from <code>Cls</code> and includes <code>Mod</code>. What will be shown?
<code>"class"</code> or <code>"module"</code>? In other words which one is closer?
The superclass or the module?
We can ask Ruby about Ruby:</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby modcls.rb
"module"
</pre>
<p>Apparently a module takes preference before the superclass.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, in Ruby an included module inherits by going in between
the class and the superclass. As a picture it might look like Fig.8.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_modclass.jpg" alt="(modclass)"><br>
Figure 8: The relation between modules and classes</p>
</p>
<p>And modules included in modules look like Fig.9</p>

<h2>The Program revisited</h2>
<p>Caution. Now I explain an extremely important element which is probably
hard to get used to for programmers who have only used static languages before.
You can skip the rest but please read this carefully. I&#8217;ll
explain this also in relative depth.</p>
<h3>Nesting of Constants</h3>
<p>First a repetition of constants. As a constant begins with a capital
letter the definition goes as follows.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
Const = 3
</pre>
<p>Now we reference the constant in this way.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(Const)   # Shows 3
</pre>
<p>Actually we can also write this.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(::Const)   # Shows 3 in the same way.
</pre>
<p>The <code>::</code> in front shows that it&#8217;s a constant defined at the top level.
You can think of the path in a filesystem. Assume there is a file <code>vmunix</code>
at rootlevel. Being at <code>/</code> one can write <code>vmunix</code> to access the file. One
can also write <code>/vmunix</code>. It&#8217;s the same with <code>Const</code> and <code>::Const</code>.
At top level it&#8217;s okay to write only <code>Const</code> or to write the full path <code>::Const</code></p>
<p>And what corresponds to a filesystem&#8217;s directories in Ruby?
That should be class and module definition statements.
However mentioning both is cumbersome, so I&#8217;ll just subsume them under
class definition. When one enters a class definition the level
for constants rises ( as if entering a directory).</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class SomeClass
  Const = 3
end

p(::SomeClass::Const)   # Shows 3
p(  SomeClass::Const)   # The same. Shows 3
</pre>
<p><code>SomeClass</code> is defined at toplevel. Hence one can reference it by writing
either <code>SomeClass</code> or <code>::SomeClass</code>. And in class is the constant
<code>Const</code>. It becomes <code>::SomeClass::Const</code>.</p>
<p>A class inside a class is like a directory in a directory.
For instance like this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C        # ::C
  class C2     # ::C::C2
    class C3   # ::C::C2::C3
    end
  end
end
</pre>
<p>Is it always necessary to reference a constant inside a class by its
full name? Of course not. As with the filesystem, if one is inside the
same class definition one can skip the <code>::</code>. It becomes like that:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class SomeClass
  Const = 3
  p(Const)   # Shows 3.
end
</pre>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; you might think. Why&#8217;s the code inside a class definition executed?
People who are used to only static languages will find this quite exceptional.
I was also flabbergasted the first time I saw it.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s add that we can of course also view a constant inside a method.
The reference rules are the same
as within the class definition (outside the method).</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  Const = "ok"
  def test()
    p(Const)
  end
end

C.new().test()   # Shows "ok"
</pre>
<h3>Everything is executed</h3>
<p>Looking at the big picture I want to write one more thing.
In Ruby almost the whole program is executed.
Constant definitions, class definitions and method definitions
and the rest is executed in the apparent order.</p>
<p>Look for instance at the following code.
I used various constructions which haven&#8217;t been used before.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
 1:  p("first")
 2:
 3:  class C &lt; Object
 4:    Const = "in C"
 5:
 6:    p(Const)
 7:
 8:    def myupcase(str)
 9:       return str.upcase()
10:    end
11:  end
12:
13:  p(C.new().myupcase("content"))
</pre>
<p>This program is executed in the following order:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>1: p("first")</code></td>
		<td>Shows <code>"first"</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>3: &lt; Object</code></td>
		<td>The constant <code>Object</code> is referenced and the class object <code>Object</code> is gained</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>3: class C</code></td>
		<td>A new class object with superclass <code>Object</code> is generated, and assigned to the constant C</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>4: Const = "in C"</code></td>
		<td>Assigning the value <code>"in C"</code> to the constant <code>::C::Const</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>6: p(Const)</code></td>
		<td>Showing the constant <code>::C::Const</code> hence <code>"in C"</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>8: def myupcase(...)...end</code></td>
		<td>Define <code>C#myupcase</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>13: C.new().myupcase(...)</code></td>
		<td>Refer the constant <code>C</code>, call the method <code>new</code> on it, and then <code>myupcase</code> on the return value</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>9: return str.upcase()</code></td>
		<td>Returns <code>"CONTENT"</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>13: p(...)</code></td>
		<td>Shows <code>"CONTENT"</code></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h3>The Scope of Local Variables</h3>
<p>At last we can talk about the scope of local variables.</p>
<p>The toplevel, the interior of a class definition, the interior of a module definition and a method body are all
scopes for independent local variables. In other words in the following program all variables
<code>lvar</code> are different. There&#8217;s no connection between them.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
lvar = 'toplevel'

class C
  lvar = 'in C'
  def method()
    lvar = 'in C#method'
  end
end

p(lvar)   # Shows "toplevel"

module M
  lvar = 'in M'
end

p(lvar)   # Shows "toplevel"
</pre>
<h3><code>self</code> as context</h3>
<p>I said before, that oneself is <code>self</code> during method execution.
That&#8217;s true but only half true. It&#8217;s really so that during execution
self is always set up. So also  at toplevel and also in a class definition.</p>
<p>For instance the <code>self</code> at the toplevel is <code>main</code>. It&#8217;s an instance
of the <code>Object</code> class, as might be expected. <code>main</code> is provided
to set up <code>self</code> for the time being. There&#8217;s no deeper meaning attached
to it.</p>
<p>Hence the toplevel&#8217;s <code>self</code> i.e. <code>main</code> is an instance of <code>Object</code>,
such that one can call the methods of <code>Object</code> there. And in <code>Object</code>
the module <code>Kernel</code> is included. In there the function type methods
like <code>p</code> and <code>puts</code> are defined (Fig.10). That&#8217;s why one can
call <code>puts</code> and <code>p</code> also at the toplevel.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_Kernel.jpg" alt="(Kernel)"><br>
Figure 10: <code>main</code>, <code>Object</code> and <code>Kernel</code></p>
</p>
<p>(トップレベル:toplevel)</p>
<p>Thus <code>p</code> isn&#8217;t a function, it&#8217;s a method. It&#8217;s just
defined in <code>Kernel</code> and thus can be called from everywhere. Or no matter what <code>self</code> is,
 <code>p</code> is a method of <code>self</code> and can be called.
That&#8217;s why there aren&#8217;t really functions in Ruby. There are only methods.</p>
<p>By the way, besides <code>p</code> and <code>puts</code> there are the function type
methods <code>print</code>, <code>puts</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>sprintf</code>, <code>gets</code>, <code>fork</code>, and <code>exec</code>
and many more with somewhat familiar names. When you look at the choice
of names you might imagine Ruby&#8217;s character.</p>
<p>I mentioned that <code>self</code> is set up everywhere, so it should also
be in a class definition. There it is the class ( class object)
itself. Hence we get this.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  p(self)   # C
end
</pre>
<p>What should this be good for?
Let&#8217;s look at a much more useful example.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module M
end
class C
  include M
end
</pre>
<p>This <code>include</code> is a method call to the class object <code>C</code>.
I haven&#8217;t mentioned it yet but the parentheses around arguments
can be omitted for method calls. And I omitted the parantheses
around <code>include</code> such that it doesn&#8217;t look like a method call, which might
have been confusing without knowing the whole story.</p>
<h3>Loading Libraries</h3>
<p>In Ruby the loading of libraries also happens at runtime.
Normally one writes this.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
require("library_name")
</pre>
<p>The impression isn&#8217;t false, <code>require</code> is a method. It&#8217;s not even
a reserved word. When one writes that line the loaded library will be
executed where the line is written. As there is no concept like Java packages in Ruby,
one has to use files and directories to separate the namespace.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
require("somelib/file1")
require("somelib/file2")
</pre>
<p>And in the library file there are usually  class and module statements. The toplevel constant scope
is independent of the file, so one can see at once classes which where defined in another file.
To partition the namespace of class names one has to explicitly nest modules as shown below.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
# example of the namespace partion of the net library
module Net
  class SMTP
    # ...
  end
  class POP
    # ...
  end
  class HTTP
    # ...
  end
end
</pre>
<h2>More about Classes</h2>
<h3>Constants revisited</h3>
<p>Up to now we used the filesystem metaphor for
the scope of constants, but I want you to completely forget that.</p>
<p>There is more about constants. Firstly one can also see constants outside
the class.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
Const = "ok"
class C
  p(Const)   # Shows "ok"
end
</pre>
<p>This becomes useful, when modules are used as namespaces.
Let&#8217;s explain this by looking at the net library from before.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module Net
  class SMTP
    # Uses Net::SMTPHelper in the methods
  end
  class SMTPHelper   # Supports the class Net::SMTP
  end
end
</pre>
<p>In this case it&#8217;s convenient to just refer to <code>SMTPHelper</code>
from within <code>SMTP</code>. That&#8217;s the reason why it&#8217;s convenient to
be able to see outside a class.</p>
<p>The outer class can be referenced over several levels.
When the same name is defined on different levels, the one which will
first be found from within will be referred to.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
Const = "far"
class C
  Const = "near" # This one is closer than the one above
  class C2
    class C3
      p(Const)   # "near" is shown
    end
  end
end
</pre>
<p>There&#8217;s another way of searching constants. If the toplevel is reached
when going further and further outside then the own superclass is
searched for the constant.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class A
  Const = "ok"
end
class B &lt; A
  p(Const)   # "ok" is shown
end
</pre>
<p>Really, that&#8217;s pretty complicated.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s summarize. When looking up a constant, first the outer class is
searched then the superclass. This is quite contrived,
but let&#8217;s assume a class hierarchy as follows.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class A1
end
class A2 &lt; A1
end
class A3 &lt; A2
  class B1
  end
  class B2 &lt; B1
  end
  class B3 &lt; B2
    class C1
    end
    class C2 &lt; C1
    end
    class C3 &lt; C2
      p(Const)
    end
  end
end
</pre>
<p>When the constant <code>Const</code> in <code>C3</code> is referenced, it&#8217;s looked
up in the order depicted in
Fig.11.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_constref.jpg" alt="(constref)"><br>
Figure 11: Search order for constants</p>
</p>
<p>Be careful about one point. The superclasses of the classes outside,
for instance <code>A1</code> and <code>B2</code>, aren&#8217;t searched at all.
If it&#8217;s outside once it&#8217;s always outside and if it&#8217;s superclass once
it&#8217;s always superclass. If it weren&#8217;t so the number of classes would
become to big and the behavior would become unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Metaclasses</h3>
<p>We said, that one can call methods on objects.
We also said that the methods which we can call
are determined by the object&#8217;s class. Then shouldn&#8217;t there be
a class for class objects? (Fig.12)</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_classclass.jpg" alt="(classclass)"><br>
Figure 12: A class of classes?</p>
</p>
<p>For this we can check Ruby.
The method which returns the class of oneself is <code>Object#class</code></p>
<pre class="emlist">
p("string".class())   # String is shown
p(String.class())     # Class is shown
p(Object.class())     # Class is shown
</pre>
<p><code>String</code> belongs to the class <code>Class</code>. Then what&#8217;s the class of <code>Class</code>?</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(Class.class())      # Class is shown
</pre>
<p>Again <code>Class</code>. In other words if one applies to any class
<code>.class().class().class()</code> long enough one reaches <code>Class</code>.
There the loop will stall. (Fig.13)</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_ccc.jpg" alt="(ccc)"><br>
Figure 13: The class of the class of the class&#8230;</p>
</p>
<p><code>Class</code> is the class of classes. And whenever there is a
recursive structure from the form X of Xs we call it a meta-X.
Hence <code>Class</code> is a metaclass.</p>
<h3>Metaobjects</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s change the subject and talk about modules.
As modules are also objects, there also should be a class for them.
Let&#8217;s see.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
module M
end
p(M.class())   # Module is shown
</pre>
<p>The class of a module seems to be <code>Module</code>. And what should be
the class of the class <code>Module</code>?</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(Module.class())   # Class
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s again <code>Class</code></p>
<p>Now we change the direction and examine the inheritance relationships.
What&#8217;s the superclass of <code>Class</code> and <code>Module</code>?
We can find it out with Ruby&#8217;s <code>Class#superclass</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p(Class.superclass())    # Module
p(Module.superclass())   # Object
p(Object.superclass())   # nil
</pre>
<p>So <code>Class</code> is a subclass of <code>Module</code>.
A diagram of the important Ruby classes is in Fig.14.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_minimum_metaobjects.jpg" alt="(metaobjects)"><br>
Figure 14: The class relationship between the important Ruby classes</p>
</p>
<p>Up to now we used <code>new</code> and <code>include</code> without an explanation of
their true form. <code>new</code> is really a method defined for the class <code>Class</code>.
That&#8217;s why <code>new</code> can be used in any class because it&#8217;s an instance
of <code>Class</code>. But <code>new</code> isn&#8217;t defined in <code>Module</code>. Hence it&#8217;s not
possible to create instances in a module. And <code>include</code> is defined
in the <code>Module</code> class. It can be called on modules and classes.</p>
<p>These three classes <code>Object</code>, <code>Module</code> and <code>class</code> are the centerpiece
of Ruby&#8217;s object world, they describe it. They are objects
describing objects. So <code>Object</code>, <code>Module</code> and <code>Class</code> are Ruby&#8217;s
metaobjects.</p>
<h3>Singleton Methods</h3>
<p>Methods can be called on objects. We said that the callable methods
are determined by the object&#8217;s class. But we also said that ideally, methods should
belong to the object. Classes are a means to
eliminate the effort of defining the same method more than once.</p>
<p>In Ruby there&#8217;s also a means to define methods for individual objects.
One writes this.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
obj = Object.new()
def obj.my_first()
  puts("My first singleton method")
end
obj.my_first()   # Shows My first singleton method
</pre>
<p>As you already know <code>Object</code> is the root for every class.
One sholdn&#8217;t add a weird method like <code>my_first</code> to such an important
class. And <code>obj</code> is an instance of <code>Object</code>. However the method <code>my_first</code>
can be called from <code>obj</code>. Hence we have created without doubt
a method which has nothing to do with the class the object belongs to.
These methods which are defined for each object individually are
called singleton methods.</p>
<p>When are singleton methods used? They are used in place  of Java or C++ static
methods. In other words methods which can be used
without creating an instance. These methods are expressed in Ruby
as singleton methods of a class object.</p>
<p>For example in <span class="caps">UNIX</span> there&#8217;s a system call <code>unlink</code>. This command
deletes a file entry from the filesystem. In Ruby it can be used
directly as the singleton method <code>unlink</code> from the <code>File</code> class.
Let&#8217;s try it out.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
File.unlink("core")  # deletes the coredump
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s cumbersome to say &#8220;the singleton method <code>unlink</code>
of the object <code>File</code>&#8221;. We simply write <code>File.unlink</code>. Don&#8217;t mix
it up and write <code>File#unlink</code>, or vice versa don&#8217;t write <code>File.write</code>
for the method <code>write</code> defined in <code>File</code>.</p>
<p>▼ A summary of the method notation</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>notation</td>
		<td>called on object</td>
		<td>example</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>File.unlink</code></td>
		<td>the <code>File</code>class itself</td>
		<td><code>File.unlink("core")</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>File#write</code></td>
		<td>an instance of <code>File</code></td>
		<td><code>f.write("str")</code></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h3>Class Variables</h3>
<p>Class variables were added to Ruby from 1.6 on, they are a relatively new mechanism.
They can be referenced and assigned from both the class and its instances.
Let&#8217;s look at an example. The beginning of the name is <code>@@</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
  @@cvar = "ok"
  p(@@cvar)      # "ok" is shown

  def print_cvar()
    p(@@cvar)
  end
end

C.new().print_cvar()  # "ok" is shown
</pre>
<p>As the first assignment serves as the definition, a reference
before an assignment leads to an error. This is shown below.
There is an ´@´ in front but the behavior differs completely
from instance variables.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby -e '
class C
  @@cvar
end
'
-e:3: uninitialized class variable @@cvar in C (NameError)
</pre>
<p>Here I was a bit lazy and used the -e option. The program
is the three lines between the single quotes.</p>
<p>Class variables are inherited. Or saying it differently,
a variable in a superior class can be assigned and referenced in the
inferior class.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class A
  @@cvar = "ok"
end

class B &lt; A
  p(@@cvar)            # Shows "ok"
  def print_cvar()
    p(@@cvar)
  end
end

B.new().print_cvar()   # Shows "ok"
</pre>
<h2>Global Variables</h2>
<p>At last there are also global variables. They can be referenced from
everywhere and assigned everywhere. The first letter of the name is a <code>$</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
$gvar = "global variable"
p($gvar)   # Shows "global variable"
</pre>
<p>As with instance variables all kinds of names are considered defined
for global variables.
In other words a reference before an assignment gives a <code>nil</code> and
doesn&#8217;t raise an error.</p>
