Translated by Vincent ISAMBART

h1. Chapter 4: Classes and modules

In this chapter, we'll see the details of the data structures created
for classes and modules.

h2. Classes and methods definition

First, I'd like to have a look at how Ruby classes are defined at the
C level. This chapter investigates almost only particular
cases, so I'd like you to know first the way used most often.

The main API to define classes and modules consists of the following 6
functions:

* `rb_define_class()`
* `rb_define_class_under()`
* `rb_define_module()`
* `rb_define_module_under()`
* `rb_define_method()`
* `rb_define_singleton_method()`

There are a few other versions of these functions, but the extension
libraries and even most of the core library is defined using just this
API. I'll introduce to you these functions one by one.

h3. Class definition

`rb_define_class()` defines a class at the top-level. Let's take the
Ruby array class, `Array`, as an example.

▼ `Array` class definition
<pre class="longlist">
  19  VALUE rb_cArray;

1809  void
1810  Init_Array()
1811  {
1812      rb_cArray  = rb_define_class("Array", rb_cObject);

(array.c)
</pre>

`rb_cObject` and `rb_cArray` correspond respectively to `Object` and
`Array` at the Ruby level. The added prefix `rb` shows that it belongs
to `ruby` and the `c` that it is a class object. These naming rules
are used everywhere in `ruby`.

This call to `rb_define_class()` defines a class called `Array`, which
inherits from `Object`. At the same time as `rb_define_class()` creates
the class object, it also defines the constant. That means that after this
you can already access `Array` from a Ruby program. It corresponds to
the following Ruby program:

<pre class="emlist">
class Array < Object
</pre>

I'd like you to note the fact that there is no `end`. It was
written like this on purpose. It is because with `rb_define_class()`
the body of the class has not been executed.

h3. Nested class definition

After that, there's `rb_define_class_under()`. This function defines a
class nested in an other class or module. This time the example is
what is returned by `stat(2)`, `File::Stat`.

▼ Definition of `File::Stat`
<pre class="longlist">
  78  VALUE rb_cFile;
  80  static VALUE rb_cStat;

2581      rb_cFile = rb_define_class("File", rb_cIO);
2674      rb_cStat = rb_define_class_under(rb_cFile, "Stat", rb_cObject);

(file.c)
</pre>

This code corresponds to the following Ruby program;

<pre class="emlist">
class File < IO
  class Stat < Object
</pre>

This time again I omitted the `end` on purpose.

h3. Module definition

`rb_define_module()` is simple so let's end this quickly.

▼ Definition of `Enumerable`
<pre class="longlist">
  17  VALUE rb_mEnumerable;

 492      rb_mEnumerable = rb_define_module("Enumerable");

(enum.c)
</pre>

The `m` in the beginning of `rb_mEnumerable` is similar to the `c` for
classes: it shows that it is a module. The corresponding Ruby program
is:

<pre class="emlist">
module Enumerable
</pre>

`rb_define_module_under()` is not used much so we'll skip it.

h3. Method definition

This time the function is the one for defining methods,
`rb_define_method()`. It's used very often. We'll take once again an
example from `Array`.

▼ Definition of `Array#to_s`
<pre class="longlist">
1818  rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "to_s", rb_ary_to_s, 0);

(array.c)
</pre>

With this the `to_s` method is defined in `Array`. The method body is
given by a function pointer (`rb_ary_to_s`). The fourth parameter is
the number of parameters taken by the method. As `to_s` does not take
any parameters, it's 0. If we write the corresponding Ruby program,
we'll have this:

<pre class="emlist">
class Array < Object
  def to_s
    # content of rb_ary_to_s()
  end
end
</pre>

Of course the `class` part is not included in `rb_define_method()` and
only the `def` part is accurate. But if there is no `class` part, it
will look like the method is defined like a function, so I also wrote
the enclosing `class` part.

One more example, this time taking a parameter:

▼ Definition of `Array#concat`
<pre class="longlist">
1835  rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "concat", rb_ary_concat, 1);

(array.c)
</pre>

The class for the definition is `rb_cArray`
(`Array`), the method name is `concat`, its body
is `rb_ary_concat()` and the number of parameters is 1. It
corresponds to writing the corresponding Ruby program:

<pre class="emlist">
class Array < Object
  def concat( str )
    # content of rb_ary_concat()
  end
end
</pre>

h3. Singleton methods definition

We can define methods that are specific to a single object instance. 
They are called singleton methods. As I used `File.unlink` as
an example in chapter 1 "Ruby language minimum", I first wanted to
show it here, but for a particular reason we'll look at `File.link`
instead.

▼ Definition of `File.link`
<pre class="longlist">
2624  rb_define_singleton_method(rb_cFile, "link", rb_file_s_link, 2);

(file.c)
</pre>

It's used like `rb_define_method()`. The only difference is that here
the first parameter is just the _object_ where the method is
defined. In this case, it's defined in `rb_cFile`.

h3. Entry point

Being able to make definitions like before is great, but where
are these functions called from, and by what means are they executed?
These definitions are grouped in functions named `Init_xxxx()`. For
instance, for `Array` a function `Init_Array()` like this has been
made:

▼ `Init_Array`
<pre class="longlist">
1809  void
1810  Init_Array()
1811  {
1812      rb_cArray  = rb_define_class("Array", rb_cObject);
1813      rb_include_module(rb_cArray, rb_mEnumerable);
1814
1815      rb_define_singleton_method(rb_cArray, "allocate",
                                     rb_ary_s_alloc, 0);
1816      rb_define_singleton_method(rb_cArray, "[]", rb_ary_s_create, -1);
1817      rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "initialize", rb_ary_initialize, -1);
1818      rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "to_s", rb_ary_to_s, 0);
1819      rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "inspect", rb_ary_inspect, 0);
1820      rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "to_a", rb_ary_to_a, 0);
1821      rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "to_ary", rb_ary_to_a, 0);
1822      rb_define_method(rb_cArray, "frozen?",  rb_ary_frozen_p, 0);

(array.c)
</pre>

The `Init` for the built-in functions are explicitly called during
the startup of `ruby`. This is done in `inits.c`.

▼ `rb_call_inits()`
<pre class="longlist">
  47  void
  48  rb_call_inits()
  49  {
  50      Init_sym();
  51      Init_var_tables();
  52      Init_Object();
  53      Init_Comparable();
  54      Init_Enumerable();
  55      Init_Precision();
  56      Init_eval();
  57      Init_String();
  58      Init_Exception();
  59      Init_Thread();
  60      Init_Numeric();
  61      Init_Bignum();
  62      Init_Array();

(inits.c)
</pre>

This way, `Init_Array()` is called properly.

That explains it for the built-in libraries, but what about extension
libraries? In fact, for extension libraries the convention is the
same. Take the following code:

<pre class="emlist">
require "myextension"
</pre>

With this, if the loaded extension library is `myextension.so`, at
load time, the (`extern`) function named `Init_myextension()` is
called. How they are called is beyond the scope of this chapter. For
that, you should read chapter 18, "Load". Here we'll just end this
with an example of `Init`.

The following example is from `stringio`, an extension library
provided with `ruby`, that is to say not from a built-in library.

▼ `Init_stringio()` (beginning)
<pre class="longlist">
 895  void
 896  Init_stringio()
 897  {
 898      VALUE StringIO = rb_define_class("StringIO", rb_cData);
 899      rb_define_singleton_method(StringIO, "allocate",
                                     strio_s_allocate, 0);
 900      rb_define_singleton_method(StringIO, "open", strio_s_open, -1);
 901      rb_define_method(StringIO, "initialize", strio_initialize, -1);
 902      rb_enable_super(StringIO, "initialize");
 903      rb_define_method(StringIO, "become", strio_become, 1);
 904      rb_define_method(StringIO, "reopen", strio_reopen, -1);

(ext/stringio/stringio.c)
</pre>

h2. Singleton classes

h3. `rb_define_singleton_method()`

You should now be able to more or less understand how normal methods are
defined. Somehow making the body of the method, then registering it
in `m_tbl` will do. But what about singleton methods? We'll now look
into the way singleton methods are defined.

▼ `rb_define_singleton_method()`
<pre class="longlist">
 721  void
 722  rb_define_singleton_method(obj, name, func, argc)
 723      VALUE obj;
 724      const char *name;
 725      VALUE (*func)();
 726      int argc;
 727  {
 728      rb_define_method(rb_singleton_class(obj), name, func, argc);
 729  }

(class.c)
</pre>

As I explained, `rb_define_method()` is a function used to define
normal methods, so the difference from normal methods is only
`rb_singleton_class()`. But what on earth are singleton classes?

In brief, singleton classes are virtual classes that are only used
to execute singleton methods. Singleton methods are functions defined
in singleton classes. Classes themselves are in the first place (in a
way) the "implementation" to link objects and methods, but singleton
classes are even more on the implementation side. In the Ruby language
way, they are not formally included, and don't appear much at the Ruby
level.

h3. `rb_singleton_class()`

Well, let's confirm what the singleton classes are made of. It's too
simple to just show you the code of a function each time so this time
I'll use a new weapon, a call graph.

<pre class="emlist">
rb_define_singleton_method
    rb_define_method
    rb_singleton_class
        SPECIAL_SINGLETON
        rb_make_metaclass
            rb_class_boot
            rb_singleton_class_attached
</pre>

Call graphs are graphs showing calling relationships among functions
(or more generally procedures). The call graphs showing all the calls
written in the source code are called static call graphs. The ones
expressing only the calls done during an execution are called dynamic
call graphs.

This diagram is a static call graph and the indentation expresses
which function calls which one. For instance,
`rb_define_singleton_method()` calls `rb_define_method()` and
`rb_singleton_class()`. And this `rb_singleton_class()` itself calls
`SPECIAL_SINGLETON()` and `rb_make_metaclass()`.

Let's go back to the code. When looking at the call graph, you can see
that the calls made by `rb_singleton_class()` go very deep. Until now
all call levels were shallow, so we could simply look at the functions
without getting too lost. But at this depth, I easily forget
what is going on in the code. That's why in those situations I check
the call graph to have a better understanding. This time, we'll decode
in parallel what the procedures below `rb_singleton_class()` do.  The
two points to look out for are the following ones:

* What exactly are singleton classes?
* What is the purpose of singleton classes?

h3. Normal classes and singleton classes

Singleton classes are special classes: they're basically the same as
normal classes, but there are a few differences. We can say that
finding these differences is explaining concretely singleton classes.

What should we do to find them? We should find the differences between
the function creating normal classes and the one creating singleton
classes. For this, we have to find the function for creating normal
classes. That is as normal classes can be defined by
`rb_define_class()`, it must call in a way or another a function to
create normal classes. For the moment, we'll not look at the content
of `rb_define_class()` itself. I have some reasons to be interested in
something that's deeper. That's why we will first look at the call
graph of `rb_define_class()`.

<pre class="emlist">
rb_define_class
    rb_class_inherited
    rb_define_class_id
        rb_class_new
            rb_class_boot
        rb_make_metaclass
            rb_class_boot
            rb_singleton_class_attached
</pre>

I'm interested by `rb_class_new()`. Doesn't this name means it creates
a new class? Let's confirm that.

▼ `rb_class_new()`
<pre class="longlist">
  37  VALUE
  38  rb_class_new(super)
  39      VALUE super;
  40  {
  41      Check_Type(super, T_CLASS);
  42      if (super == rb_cClass) {
  43          rb_raise(rb_eTypeError, "can't make subclass of Class");
  44      }
  45      if (FL_TEST(super, FL_SINGLETON)) {
  46          rb_raise(rb_eTypeError, "can't make subclass of virtual class");
  47      }
  48      return rb_class_boot(super);
  49  }

(class.c)
</pre>

`Check_Type()` is checks the type of object structure, so we can
ignore it. `rb_raise()` is error handling so we can ignore it. Only
`rb_class_boot()` remains. So let's look at it.

▼ `rb_class_boot()`
<pre class="longlist">
  21  VALUE
  22  rb_class_boot(super)
  23      VALUE super;
  24  {
  25      NEWOBJ(klass, struct RClass);        /* allocates struct RClass */
  26      OBJSETUP(klass, rb_cClass, T_CLASS); /* initialization of the RBasic part */
  27
  28      klass->super = super;       /* (A) */
  29      klass->iv_tbl = 0;
  30      klass->m_tbl = 0;
  31      klass->m_tbl = st_init_numtable();
  32
  33      OBJ_INFECT(klass, super);
  34      return (VALUE)klass;
  35  }

(class.c)
</pre>

`NEWOBJ()` and `OBJSETUP()` are fixed expressions used when creating
Ruby objects that possess one of the internal structure types (`struct
Rxxxx`). They are both macros. In `NEWOBJ()`, `struct RClass` is
created and the pointer is put in its first parameter `klass`. In
`OBJSETUP()`, the struct `RBasic` member of the `RClass` (and thus
`basic.klass` and `basic.flags`) is initialized.

`OBJ_INFECT()` is a macro related to security. From now on, we'll
ignore it.

At (A), the `super` member of `klass`is set to the `super`
parameter. It looks like `rb_class_boot()` is a function that creates
a class inheriting from `super`.

So, as `rb_class_boot()` is a function that creates a class,
what does `rb_class_new()` is very similar.

Then, let's once more look at `rb_singleton_class()`'s call graph:

<pre class="emlist">
rb_singleton_class
    SPECIAL_SINGLETON
    rb_make_metaclass
        rb_class_boot
        rb_singleton_class_attached
</pre>

Here also `rb_class_boot()` is called. So up to that point, it's the
same as in normal classes. What's going on after is what's different
between normal classes and singleton classes, in other words the
characteristics of singleton classes. If everything's clear so
far, we just need to read `rb_singleton_class()` and
`rb_make_metaclass()`.

h3. Compressed `rb_singleton_class()`

`rb_singleton_class()` is a little long so we'll first remove its
non-essential parts.

▼ `rb_singleton_class()`
<pre class="longlist">
 678  #define SPECIAL_SINGLETON(x,c) do {\
 679      if (obj == (x)) {\
 680          return c;\
 681      }\
 682  } while (0)

 684  VALUE
 685  rb_singleton_class(obj)
 686      VALUE obj;
 687  {
 688      VALUE klass;
 689
 690      if (FIXNUM_P(obj) || SYMBOL_P(obj)) {
 691          rb_raise(rb_eTypeError, "can't define singleton");
 692      }
 693      if (rb_special_const_p(obj)) {
 694          SPECIAL_SINGLETON(Qnil, rb_cNilClass);
 695          SPECIAL_SINGLETON(Qfalse, rb_cFalseClass);
 696          SPECIAL_SINGLETON(Qtrue, rb_cTrueClass);
 697          rb_bug("unknown immediate %ld", obj);
 698      }
 699
 700      DEFER_INTS;
 701      if (FL_TEST(RBASIC(obj)->klass, FL_SINGLETON) &&
 702          (BUILTIN_TYPE(obj) == T_CLASS ||
 703           rb_iv_get(RBASIC(obj)->klass, "__attached__") == obj)) {
 704          klass = RBASIC(obj)->klass;
 705      }
 706      else {
 707          klass = rb_make_metaclass(obj, RBASIC(obj)->klass);
 708      }
 709      if (OBJ_TAINTED(obj)) {
 710          OBJ_TAINT(klass);
 711      }
 712      else {
 713          FL_UNSET(klass, FL_TAINT);
 714      }
 715      if (OBJ_FROZEN(obj)) OBJ_FREEZE(klass);
 716      ALLOW_INTS;
 717
 718      return klass;
 719  }

(class.c)
</pre>

The first and the second half are separated by a blank line. The first
half handles a special case and the second half handles the general
case. In other words, the second half is the trunk of the
function. That's why we'll keep it for later and talk about the first
half.

Everything that is handled in the first half are non-pointer `VALUE`s,
in other words objects without an existing C structure. First,
`Fixnum` and `Symbol` are explicitly picked. Then,
`rb_special_const_p()` is a function that returns true for non-pointer
`VALUE`s, so there only `Qtrue`, `Qfalse` and `Qnil` should get
caught. Other than that, there are no valid non-pointer value so a bug
is reported with `rb_bug()`.

`DEFER_INTS()` and `ALLOW_INTS()` both end with the same `INTS` so you
should see a pair in them. That's the case, and they are macros
related to signals. Because they are defined in `rubysig.h`, you can
guess that `INTS` is the abbreviation of interrupts. You can ignore
them.

h3. Compressed `rb_make_metaclass()`

▼ `rb_make_metaclass()`
<pre class="longlist">
 142  VALUE
 143  rb_make_metaclass(obj, super)
 144      VALUE obj, super;
 145  {
 146      VALUE klass = rb_class_boot(super);
 147      FL_SET(klass, FL_SINGLETON);
 148      RBASIC(obj)->klass = klass;
 149      rb_singleton_class_attached(klass, obj);
 150      if (BUILTIN_TYPE(obj) == T_CLASS) {
 151          RBASIC(klass)->klass = klass;
 152          if (FL_TEST(obj, FL_SINGLETON)) {
 153              RCLASS(klass)->super =
                          RBASIC(rb_class_real(RCLASS(obj)->super))->klass;
 154          }
 155      }
 156
 157      return klass;
 158  }

(class.c)
</pre>

We already saw `rb_class_boot()`. It creates a (normal) class using
the `super` parameter as its superclass. After that, the
`FL_SINGLETON` of this class is set. This is clearly suspicious. The
name of the function makes us think that it is not the indication of
a singleton class.

h3. What are singleton classes?

Continuing the simplification process, furthermore as parameters,
return values, local variables are all `VALUE`, we can throw away the
declarations. That makes us able to compress to the following:

▼ `rb_singleton_class() rb_make_metaclass()` (after compression)
<pre class="longlist">
rb_singleton_class(obj)
{
    if (FL_TEST(RBASIC(obj)->klass, FL_SINGLETON) &&
        (BUILTIN_TYPE(obj) == T_CLASS || BUILTIN_TYPE(obj) == T_MODULE) &&
        rb_iv_get(RBASIC(obj)->klass, "__attached__") == obj) {
        klass = RBASIC(obj)->klass;
    }
    else {
        klass = rb_make_metaclass(obj, RBASIC(obj)->klass);
    }
    return klass;
}

rb_make_metaclass(obj, super)
{
    klass = create a class with super as superclass;
    FL_SET(klass, FL_SINGLETON);
    RBASIC(obj)->klass = klass;
    rb_singleton_class_attached(klass, obj);
    if (BUILTIN_TYPE(obj) == T_CLASS) {
        RBASIC(klass)->klass = klass;
        if (FL_TEST(obj, FL_SINGLETON)) {
            RCLASS(klass)->super =
                    RBASIC(rb_class_real(RCLASS(obj)->super))->klass;
        }
    }

    return klass;
}
</pre>

The condition of the `if` statement of `rb_singleton_class()` seems
quite complicated. However, this condition is not connected to the
mainstream of `rb_make_metaclass()` so we'll see it later. Let's first
think about what happens on the false branch of the `if`.

The `BUILTIN_TYPE()` of `rb_make_metaclass()` is similar to `TYPE()`
as it is a macro to get the structure type flag (`T_xxxx`). That means
this check in `rb_make_metaclass` means "if `obj` is a class". For the
moment it's better not to limit ourselves to `obj` being a class, so
we'll remove it.

With these simplifications, we get the the following:

▼ `rb_singleton_class() rb_make_metaclass()` (after recompression)
<pre class="longlist">
rb_singleton_class(obj)
{
    klass = create a class with RBASIC(obj)->klass as superclass;
    FL_SET(klass, FL_SINGLETON);
    RBASIC(obj)->klass = klass;
    return klass;
}
</pre>

But there is still a quite hard to understand side to it. That's
because `klass` is used too often. So let's rename the `klass`
variable to `sclass`.

▼ `rb_singleton_class() rb_make_metaclass()` (variable substitution)
<pre class="longlist">
rb_singleton_class(obj)
{
    sclass = create a class with RBASIC(obj)->klass as superclass;
    FL_SET(sclass, FL_SINGLETON);
    RBASIC(obj)->klass = sclass;
    return sclass;
}
</pre>

Now it should be very easy to understand. To make it even simpler,
I've represented what is done with a diagram (figure 1). In the
horizontal direction is the "instance - class" relation, and in the
vertical direction is inheritance (the superclasses are above).

!images/ch_class_addsclass.png(`rb_singleton_class`)!

When comparing the first and last part of this diagram, you can
understand that `sclass` is inserted without changing the
structure. That's all there is to singleton classes. In other words
the inheritance is increased one step. If a method is defined in a
singleton class, this construction allows the other instances of
`klass` to define completely different methods.

h3. Singleton classes and instances

By the way, you must have seen that during the compression process,
the call to `rb_singleton_class_attached()` was stealthily
removed. Here:

<pre class="emlist">
rb_make_metaclass(obj, super)
{
    klass = create a class with super as superclass;
    FL_SET(klass, FL_SINGLETON);
    RBASIC(obj)->klass = klass;
    rb_singleton_class_attached(klass, obj);   /* THIS */
</pre>

Let's have a look at what it does.

▼ `rb_singleton_class_attached()`
<pre class="longlist">
 130  void
 131  rb_singleton_class_attached(klass, obj)
 132      VALUE klass, obj;
 133  {
 134      if (FL_TEST(klass, FL_SINGLETON)) {
 135          if (!RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl) {
 136              RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl = st_init_numtable();
 137          }
 138          st_insert(RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl,
                        rb_intern("__attached__"), obj);
 139      }
 140  }

(class.c)
</pre>

If the FL_SINGLETON flag of `klass` is set... in other words if it's a
singleton class, put the `__attached__` → `obj` relation in the
instance variable table of `klass` (`iv_tbl`). That's how it looks
like (in our case `klass` is always a singleton class... in other
words its `FL_SINGLETON` flag is always set).

`__attached__` does not have the `@` prefix, but it's stored in the
instance variables table so it's still an instance variable. Such an
instance variable can never be read at the Ruby level so it can be
used to keep values for the system's exclusive use.

Let's now think about the relationship between `klass` and
`obj`. `klass` is the singleton class of `obj`. In other words, this
"invisible" instance variable allows the singleton class to remember
the instance it was created from. Its value is used when the singleton
class is changed, notably to call hook methods on the instance
(i.e. `obj`). For example, when a method is added to a singleton
class, the `obj`'s `singleton_method_added` method is called. There is
no logical necessity to doing it, it was done because that's how it
was defined in the language.

But is it really all right? Storing the instance in `__attached__`
will force one singleton class to have only one attached instance. For
example, by getting (in some way or an other) the singleton class and
calling `new` on it, won't a singleton class end up having multiple
instances?

This cannot be done because the proper checks are done to prevent the
creation of an instance of a singleton class.

Singleton classes are in the first place for singleton
methods. Singleton methods are methods existing only on a particular
object. If singleton classes could have multiple instances, there
would the same as normal classes. That's why they are forced to only
have one instance.

h3. Summary

We've done a lot, maybe made a real mayhem, so let's finish and put
everything in order with a summary.

What are singleton classes? They are classes that have the
`FL_SINGLETON` flag set and that can only have one instance.

What are singleton methods? They are methods defined in the singleton
class of an object.

h2. Metaclasses

h3. Inheritance of singleton methods

h4. Infinite chain of classes

Even a class has a class, and it's `Class`. And the class of `Class`
is again `Class`. We find ourselves in an infinite loop (figure 2).

!images/ch_class_infloop.png(Infinite loop of classes)!

Up to here it's something we've already gone through. What's going
after that is the theme of this chapter. Why do classes have to make a
loop?

First, in Ruby all data are objects. And classes are data so in Ruby
they have to be objects.

As they are objects, they must answer to methods. And setting the rule
"to answer to methods you must belong to a class" made processing
easier. That's where comes the need for a class to also have a class.

Let's base ourselves on this and think about the way to implement it.
First, we can try first with the most naïve way, `Class`'s class is
`ClassClass`, `ClassClass`'s class is `ClassClassClass`..., chaining
classes of classes one by one. But whichever the way you look at it,
this can't be implemented effectively. That's why it's common in
object oriented languages where classes are objects that `Class`'s
class is to `Class` itself, creating an endless virtual instance-class
relationship.

I'm repeating myself, but the fact that `Class`'s class is `Class` is
only to make the implementation easier, there's nothing important in
this logic.

h4. "Class is also an object"

"Everything is an object" is often used as advertising statement when
speaking about Ruby. And as a part of that, "Classes are also objects!"
also appears. But these expressions often go too far. When thinking
about these sayings, we have to split them in two:

* all data are objects
* classes are data

Talking about data or code makes a discussion much harder to
understand. That's why here we'll restrict the meaning of "data" to
"what can be put in variables in programs".

Being able to manipulate classes from programs gives programs the
ability to manipulate themselves. This is called reflection. It fits
object oriented languages, and even more Ruby with the classes it has,
to be able to directly manipulate classes.

Nevertheless, classes could be made available in a form that is not an
object. For example, classes could be manipulated with function-style
methods (functions defined at the top-level). However, as inside the
interpreter there are data structures to represent the classes, it's
more natural in object oriented languages to make them available
directly. And Ruby did this choice.

Furthermore, an objective in Ruby is for all data to be
objects. That's why it's appropriate to make them objects.

By the way, there is a reason not linked to reflection why in Ruby
classes had to be made objects. That is to be able to define methods
independently from instances (what is called static methods in Java in
C++).

And to implement static methods, another thing was necessary:
singleton methods. By chain reaction, that also makes singleton
classes necessary. Figure 3 shows these dependency relationships.

!images/ch_class_reqlink.png(Requirements dependencies)!

h4. Class methods inheritance

In Ruby, singleton methods defined in a class are called class
methods. However, their specification is a little strange. Why are
class methods inherited?

<pre class="emlist">
class A
  def A.test    # defines a singleton method in A
    puts("ok")
  end
end

class B < A
end

B.test()  # calls it
</pre>

This can't occur with singleton methods from objects that are not
classes. In other words, classes are the only ones handled
specially. In the following section we'll see how class methods are
inherited.

h3. Singleton class of a class

Assuming that class methods are inherited, where is this operation
done? At class definition (creation)? At singleton method definition?
Then let's look at the code defining classes.

Class definition means of course `rb_define_class()`. Now
let's take the call graph of this function.

<pre class="emlist">
rb_define_class
    rb_class_inherited
    rb_define_class_id
        rb_class_new
            rb_class_boot
        rb_make_metaclass
            rb_class_boot
            rb_singleton_class_attached
</pre>

If you're wondering where you've seen it before, we looked at it in
the previous section. At that time you did not see it but if you look
closely, why does `rb_make_metaclass()` appear? As we saw before, this
function introduces a singleton class. This is very suspicious. Why is
this called even if we are not defining a singleton function?
Furthermore, why is the lower level `rb_make_metaclass()` used instead
of `rb_singleton_class()`? It looks like we have to check these
surroundings again.

h4. `rb_define_class_id()`

Let's first start our reading with its caller, `rb_define_class_id()`.

▼ `rb_define_class_id()`
<pre class="longlist">
 160  VALUE
 161  rb_define_class_id(id, super)
 162      ID id;
 163      VALUE super;
 164  {
 165      VALUE klass;
 166
 167      if (!super) super = rb_cObject;
 168      klass = rb_class_new(super);
 169      rb_name_class(klass, id);
 170      rb_make_metaclass(klass, RBASIC(super)->klass);
 171
 172      return klass;
 173  }

(class.c)
</pre>

`rb_class_new()` was a function that creates a class with `super` as
its superclass. `rb_name_class()`'s name means it names a class, but
for the moment we do note care about names so we'll skip it. After
that there's the `rb_make_metaclass()` in question. I'm concerned by
the fact that when called from `rb_singleton_class()`, the parameters
were different. Last time was like this:

<pre class="emlist">
rb_make_metaclass(obj, RBASIC(obj)->klass);
</pre>

But this time is like this:

<pre class="emlist">
rb_make_metaclass(klass, RBASIC(super)->klass);
</pre>

So as you can see it's slightly different. How do the results change
depending on that? Let's have once again a look at a simplified
`rb_make_metaclass()`.

h4. `rb_make_metaclass` (once more)

▼ `rb_make_metaclass` (after first compression)
<pre class="longlist">
rb_make_metaclass(obj, super)
{
    klass = create a class with super as superclass;
    FL_SET(klass, FL_SINGLETON);
    RBASIC(obj)->klass = klass;
    rb_singleton_class_attached(klass, obj);
    if (BUILTIN_TYPE(obj) == T_CLASS) {
        RBASIC(klass)->klass = klass;
        if (FL_TEST(obj, FL_SINGLETON)) {
            RCLASS(klass)->super =
                    RBASIC(rb_class_real(RCLASS(obj)->super))->klass;
        }
    }

    return klass;
}
</pre>

Last time, the `if` statement was skillfully skipped, but looking once
again, something is done only for `T_CLASS`, in other words
classes. This clearly looks important. In `rb_define_class_id()`, as
it's called like this:

<pre class="emlist">
rb_make_metaclass(klass, RBASIC(super)->klass);
</pre>

Let's expand `rb_make_metaclass()`'s parameter variables with this
values.

▼ `rb_make_metaclass` (recompression)
<pre class="longlist">
rb_make_metaclass(klass, super_klass /* == RBASIC(super)->klass */)
{
    sclass = create a class with super_class as superclass;
    RBASIC(klass)->klass = sclass;
    RBASIC(sclass)->klass = sclass;
    return sclass;
}
</pre>

Doing this as a diagram gives something like figure 4. In it, the
names between parentheses are singleton classes. This notation is
often used in this book so I'd like you to remember it. This means
that `obj`'s singleton class is written as `(obj)`. And `(klass)` is
the singleton class for `klass`. It looks like the singleton class is
caught between a class and this class's superclass's class.

!images/ch_class_metaclass.png(Introduction of a class's singleton class)!

From this result, and moreover when thinking more deeply, we can think
that the superclass's class must again be the superclass's singleton
class. You'll understand with one more inheritance level (figure 5).

!images/ch_class_multi.png(Hierarchy of multi-level inheritance)!

As the relationship between `super` and `klass` is the same as the one
between `klass` and `klass2`, `c` must be the singleton class
`(super)`. If you continue like this, finally you'll arrive at the
conclusion that `Object`'s class must be `(Object)`. And that's the
case in practice. For example, by inheriting like in the following
program :

<pre class="emlist">
class A < Object
end
class B < A
end
</pre>

internally, a structure like figure 6 is created.

!images/ch_class_metatree.png(Class hierarchy and metaclasses)!

As classes and their metaclasses are linked and inherit like this,
class methods are inherited.

h3. Class of a class of a class

You've understood the working of class methods inheritance, but by
doing that, in the opposite some questions have appeared. What is the
class of a class's singleton class? To do this we can try
debugging. I've made the figure 7 from the results of this
investigation.

!images/ch_class_mmm.png(Class of a class's singleton class)!

A class's singleton class puts itself as its own class. Quite
complicated.

The second question: the class of `Object` must be `Class`. Didn't I
properly confirm this in chapter 1: Ruby language minimum?

<pre class="emlist">
p(Object.class())   # Class
</pre>

Certainly, that's the case "at the Ruby level". But "at the C level",
it's the singleton class `(Object)`. If `(Object)` does not appear at
the Ruby level, it's because `Object#class` skips the singleton
classes. Let's look at the body of the method, `rb_obj_class()` to
confirm that.

▼ `rb_obj_class()`
<pre class="longlist">
  86  VALUE
  87  rb_obj_class(obj)
  88      VALUE obj;
  89  {
  90      return rb_class_real(CLASS_OF(obj));
  91  }

  76  VALUE
  77  rb_class_real(cl)
  78      VALUE cl;
  79  {
  80      while (FL_TEST(cl, FL_SINGLETON) || TYPE(cl) == T_ICLASS) {
  81          cl = RCLASS(cl)->super;
  82      }
  83      return cl;
  84  }

(object.c)
</pre>

`CLASS_OF(obj)` returns the `basic.klass` of `obj`. While in
`rb_class_real()`, all singleton classes are skipped (advancing
towards the superclass). In the first place, singleton class are
caught between a class and its superclass, like a proxy. That's why
when a "real" class is necessary, we have to follow the superclass
chain (figure 8).

`I_CLASS` will appear later when we will talk about include.

!images/ch_class_real.png(Singleton class and real class)!

h3. Singleton class and metaclass

Well, the singleton classes that were introduced in classes is also
one type of class, it's a class's class. So it can be called
metaclass.

However, you should be wary of the fact that singleton class are
not metaclasses. It's the singleton classes introduced in classes that
are metaclasses. The important fact is not that they are singleton
classes, but that they are the classes of classes. I was stuck on this
point when I started learning Ruby. As I may not be the only one, I
would like to make this clear.

Thinking about this, the `rb_make_metaclass()` function name is not
very good. When used in classes, it does indeed create a metaclass,
but not in the other cases, when using objects.

Then finally, even if you understood that some class are metaclasses,
it's not as if there was any concrete gain. I'd like you not to care
too much about it.

h3. Bootstrap

We have nearly finished our talk about classes and metaclasses. But
there is still one problem left. It's about the 3 metaobjects
`Object`, `Module` and `Class`. These 3 cannot be created with the
common use API. To make a class, its metaclass must be built, but like
we saw some time ago, the metaclass's superclass is `Class`. However,
as `Class` has not been created yet, the metaclass cannot be build. So
in `ruby`, only these 3 classes's creation is handled specially.

Then let's look at the code:

▼ `Object`, `Module` and `Class` creation
<pre class="longlist">
1243  rb_cObject = boot_defclass("Object", 0);
1244  rb_cModule = boot_defclass("Module", rb_cObject);
1245  rb_cClass =  boot_defclass("Class",  rb_cModule);
1246
1247  metaclass = rb_make_metaclass(rb_cObject, rb_cClass);
1248  metaclass = rb_make_metaclass(rb_cModule, metaclass);
1249  metaclass = rb_make_metaclass(rb_cClass, metaclass);

(object.c)
</pre>

First, in the first half, `boot_defclass()` is similar to
`rb_class_boot()`, it just creates a class with its given superclass
set. These links give us something like the left part of figure 9.

And in the three lines of the second half, `(Object)`, `(Module)` and
`(Class)` are created and set (right figure 9). `(Object)` and
`(Module)`'s classes... that is themselves... is already set in
`rb_make_metaclass()` so there is no problem. With this, the
metaobjects' bootstrap is finished.

!images/ch_class_boot1.png(Metaobjects creation)!

After taking everything into account, it gives us a the final shape
like figure 10.

!images/ch_class_metaobj.png(Ruby metaobjects)!

h2. Class names

In this section, we will analyse how's formed the reciprocal
conversion between class and class names, in other words
constants. Concretely, we will target `rb_define_class()` and
`rb_define_class_under()`.

h3. Name → class

First we'll read `rb_defined_class()`. After the end of this function,
the class can be found from the constant.

▼ `rb_define_class()`
<pre class="longlist">
 183  VALUE
 184  rb_define_class(name, super)
 185      const char *name;
 186      VALUE super;
 187  {
 188      VALUE klass;
 189      ID id;
 190
 191      id = rb_intern(name);
 192      if (rb_autoload_defined(id)) {             /* (A) autoload */
 193          rb_autoload_load(id);
 194      }
 195      if (rb_const_defined(rb_cObject, id)) {    /* (B) rb_const_defined */
 196          klass = rb_const_get(rb_cObject, id);  /* (C) rb_const_get */
 197          if (TYPE(klass) != T_CLASS) {
 198              rb_raise(rb_eTypeError, "%s is not a class", name);
 199          }                                      /* (D) rb_class_real */
 200          if (rb_class_real(RCLASS(klass)->super) != super) {
 201              rb_name_error(id, "%s is already defined", name);
 202          }
 203          return klass;
 204      }
 205      if (!super) {
 206          rb_warn("no super class for '%s', Object assumed", name);
 207      }
 208      klass = rb_define_class_id(id, super);
 209      rb_class_inherited(super, klass);
 210      st_add_direct(rb_class_tbl, id, klass);
 211
 212      return klass;
 213  }

(class.c)
</pre>

Many things can be understood with what's before and after
`rb_define_class_id()`... Before we acquire or create the class. After
we set the constant. We will look at it in more detail below.

(A) In Ruby, there is an autoload function that automatically loads
libraries when some constants are accessed. This is done in the
`rb_autoload_xxxx()` function. You can ignore it without any problem.

(B) We determine whether the `name` constant has been defined or not
in `Object`.

(C) Get the value of the `name` constant. This will be explained in
detail in chapter 6.

(D) We've seen `rb_class_real()` some time ago. If the class `c` is a
singleton class or an `ICLASS`, it climbs the `super` hierarchy up to
a class that is not and returns it. In short, this function skips the
virtual classes that should not appear at the Ruby level.

That's what we can read nearby.

As around constants are involved, it is very troublesome. However, we
will talk about class definition in the constants chapter so for the
moment we will content ourselves with a partial description.

After `rb_define_class_id`, we can find the following:

<pre class="emlist">
st_add_direct(rb_class_tbl, id, klass);
</pre>

This part assigns the class to the constant. However, whichever
way you look at it you do not see that. In fact, top-level classes are
separated from the other constants and regrouped in
`rb_class_tbl()`. The split is slightly related to the GC. It's not
essential.

h3. Class → name

We understood how the class can be obtained from the class name, but
how to do the opposite? By doing things like calling `p` or
`Class#name`, we can get the name of the class, but how is it
implemented?

In fact this was already done a long time ago by
`rb_name_class()`. The call is around the following:

<pre class="emlist">
rb_define_class
    rb_define_class_id
        rb_name_class
</pre>

Let's look at its content:

▼ `rb_name_class()`
<pre class="longlist">
 269  void
 270  rb_name_class(klass, id)
 271      VALUE klass;
 272      ID id;
 273  {
 274      rb_iv_set(klass, "__classid__", ID2SYM(id));
 275  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

`__classid__` is another instance variable that can't be seen from
Ruby. As only `VALUE`s can be put in the instance variable table, the
`ID` is converted to `Symbol` using `ID2SYM()`.

That's how we are able to find the constant name from the class.

h3. Nested classes

So, in the case of classes defined at the top-level, we know how works
the reciprocal link between name and class. What's left is the case of
classes defined in modules or other classes, and for that it's a
little more complicated. The function to define these nested classes
is `rb_define_class_under()`.

▼ `rb_define_class_under()`
<pre class="longlist">
 215  VALUE
 216  rb_define_class_under(outer, name, super)
 217      VALUE outer;
 218      const char *name;
 219      VALUE super;
 220  {
 221      VALUE klass;
 222      ID id;
 223
 224      id = rb_intern(name);
 225      if (rb_const_defined_at(outer, id)) {
 226          klass = rb_const_get(outer, id);
 227          if (TYPE(klass) != T_CLASS) {
 228              rb_raise(rb_eTypeError, "%s is not a class", name);
 229          }
 230          if (rb_class_real(RCLASS(klass)->super) != super) {
 231              rb_name_error(id, "%s is already defined", name);
 232          }
 233          return klass;
 234      }
 235      if (!super) {
 236          rb_warn("no super class for '%s::%s', Object assumed",
 237                  rb_class2name(outer), name);
 238      }
 239      klass = rb_define_class_id(id, super);
 240      rb_set_class_path(klass, outer, name);
 241      rb_class_inherited(super, klass);
 242      rb_const_set(outer, id, klass);
 243
 244      return klass;
 245  }

(class.c)
</pre>

The structure is like the one of `rb_define_class()`: before the call
to `rb_define_class_id()` is the redefinition check, after is the
creation of the reciprocal link between constant and class. The first
half is pretty boringly similar to `rb_define_class()` so we'll skip
it. In the second half, `rb_set_class()` is new. We're going to look
at it.

h4. `rb_set_class_path()`

This function gives the name `name` to the class `klass` nested in the
class `under`. "class path" means a name including all the nesting
information starting from top-level, for example
"`Net::NetPrivate::Socket`".

▼ `rb_set_class_path()`
<pre class="longlist">
 210  void
 211  rb_set_class_path(klass, under, name)
 212      VALUE klass, under;
 213      const char *name;
 214  {
 215      VALUE str;
 216
 217      if (under == rb_cObject) {
              /* defined at top-level */
 218          str = rb_str_new2(name);    /* create a Ruby string from name */
 219      }
 220      else {
              /* nested constant */
 221          str = rb_str_dup(rb_class_path(under));  /* copy the return value */
 222          rb_str_cat2(str, "::");     /* concatenate "::" */
 223          rb_str_cat2(str, name);     /* concatenate name */
 224      }
 225      rb_iv_set(klass, "__classpath__", str);
 226  }

(variable.c)
</pre>

Everything except the last line is the construction of the class path,
and the last line makes the class remember its own
name. `__classpath__` is of course another instance variable that
can't be seen from a Ruby program. In `rb_name_class()` there was
`__classid__`, but `id` is different because it does not include
nesting information (look at the table below).

<pre class="emlist">
__classpath__    Net::NetPrivate::Socket
__classid__                       Socket
</pre>

It means classes defined for example in `rb_defined_class()` all have
`__classid__` or `__classpath__` defined. So to find `under`'s
classpath we can look up in these instance variables. This is done by
`rb_class_path()`. We'll omit its content.

h3. Nameless classes

Contrary to what I have just said, there are in fact cases in which
neither `__classpath__` nor `__classid__` are set. That is because in
Ruby you can use a method like the following to create a class.

<pre class="emlist">
c = Class.new()
</pre>

If you create a class like this, we won't go through
`rb_define_class_id()` and the classpath won't be set. In this case,
`c` does not have any name, which is to say we get an unnamed class.

However, if later it's assigned to a constant, the name of this
constant will be attached to the class.

<pre class="emlist">
SomeClass = c   # the class name is SomeClass
</pre>

Strictly speaking, the name is attached after the assignment, the
first time it is requested. For instance, when calling `p` on this
`SomeClass` class or when calling the `Class#name` method. When doing
this, a value equal to the class is searched in `rb_class_tbl`, and a
name has to be chosen. The following case can also happen:

<pre class="emlist">
class A
  class B
    C = tmp = Class.new()
    p(tmp)   # here we search for the name
  end
end
</pre>

so in the worst case we have to search for the whole constant
space. However, generally, there aren't many constants so searching
all constants does not take too much time.

h2. Include

We only talked about classes so let's finish this chapter with
something else and talk about module inclusion.

h3. `rb_include_module` (1)

Includes are done by the ordinary method `Module#include`. Its
corresponding function in C is `rb_include_module()`. In fact, to be
precise, its body is `rb_mod_include()`, and there
`Module#append_feature` is called, and this function's default
implementation finally calls `rb_include_module()`. Mixing what's
happening in Ruby and C gives us the following call graph.

<pre class="emlist">
Module#include (rb_mod_include)
    Module#append_features (rb_mod_append_features)
        rb_include_module
</pre>

All usual includes are done by `rb_include_module()`. This function is
a little long so we'll look at it a half at a time.

▼ `rb_include_module` (first half)
<pre class="longlist">
      /* include module in class */
 347  void
 348  rb_include_module(klass, module)
 349      VALUE klass, module;
 350  {
 351      VALUE p, c;
 352      int changed = 0;
 353
 354      rb_frozen_class_p(klass);
 355      if (!OBJ_TAINTED(klass)) {
 356          rb_secure(4);
 357      }
 358
 359      if (NIL_P(module)) return;
 360      if (klass == module) return;
 361
 362      switch (TYPE(module)) {
 363        case T_MODULE:
 364        case T_CLASS:
 365        case T_ICLASS:
 366          break;
 367        default:
 368          Check_Type(module, T_MODULE);
 369      }

(class.c)
</pre>

For the moment it's only security and type checking, therefore we can
ignore it. The process itself is below:

▼ `rb_include_module` (second half)
<pre class="longlist">
 371      OBJ_INFECT(klass, module);
 372      c = klass;
 373      while (module) {
 374          int superclass_seen = Qfalse;
 375
 376          if (RCLASS(klass)->m_tbl == RCLASS(module)->m_tbl)
 377              rb_raise(rb_eArgError, "cyclic include detected");
 378          /* (A) skip if the superclass already includes module */
 379          for (p = RCLASS(klass)->super; p; p = RCLASS(p)->super) {
 380              switch (BUILTIN_TYPE(p)) {
 381                case T_ICLASS:
 382                  if (RCLASS(p)->m_tbl == RCLASS(module)->m_tbl) {
 383                      if (!superclass_seen) {
 384                          c = p;  /* move the insertion point */
 385                      }
 386                      goto skip;
 387                  }
 388                  break;
 389                case T_CLASS:
 390                  superclass_seen = Qtrue;
 391                  break;
 392              }
 393          }
 394          c = RCLASS(c)->super =
                          include_class_new(module, RCLASS(c)->super);
 395          changed = 1;
 396        skip:
 397          module = RCLASS(module)->super;
 398      }
 399      if (changed) rb_clear_cache();
 400  }

(class.c)
</pre>

First, what the (A) block does is written in the comment. It seems to
be a special condition so let's first skip reading it for now. By
extracting the important parts from the rest we get the following:

<pre class="emlist">
c = klass;
while (module) {
    c = RCLASS(c)->super = include_class_new(module, RCLASS(c)->super);
    module = RCLASS(module)->super;
}
</pre>

In other words, it's a repetition of `module`'s `super`. What is in
`module`'s `super` must be a module included by `module` (because our
intuition tells us so). Then the superclass of the class where the
inclusion occurs is replaced with something. We do not understand much
what, but at the moment I saw that I felt "Ah, doesn't this look the
addition of elements to a list (like LISP's cons)?" and it suddenly
make the story faster. In other words it's the following form:

<pre class="emlist">
list = new(item, list)
</pre>

Thinking about this, it seems we can expect that module is inserted
between `c` and `c->super`. If it's like this, it fits module's
specification.

But to be sure of this we have to look at `include_class_new()`.

h3. `include_class_new()`

▼ `include_class_new()`
<pre class="longlist">
 319  static VALUE
 320  include_class_new(module, super)
 321      VALUE module, super;
 322  {
 323      NEWOBJ(klass, struct RClass);               /* (A) */
 324      OBJSETUP(klass, rb_cClass, T_ICLASS);
 325
 326      if (BUILTIN_TYPE(module) == T_ICLASS) {
 327          module = RBASIC(module)->klass;
 328      }
 329      if (!RCLASS(module)->iv_tbl) {
 330          RCLASS(module)->iv_tbl = st_init_numtable();
 331      }
 332      klass->iv_tbl = RCLASS(module)->iv_tbl;     /* (B) */
 333      klass->m_tbl = RCLASS(module)->m_tbl;
 334      klass->super = super;                       /* (C) */
 335      if (TYPE(module) == T_ICLASS) {             /* (D) */
 336          RBASIC(klass)->klass = RBASIC(module)->klass;   /* (D-1) */
 337      }
 338      else {
 339          RBASIC(klass)->klass = module;                  /* (D-2) */
 340      }
 341      OBJ_INFECT(klass, module);
 342      OBJ_INFECT(klass, super);
 343
 344      return (VALUE)klass;
 345  }

(class.c)
</pre>

We're lucky there's nothing we do not know.

(A) First create a new class.

(B) Transplant `module`'s instance variable and method tables into
this class.

(C) Make the including class's superclass (`super`) the super class of
this new class.

In other words, this function creates an include class for the
module. The important point is that at (B) only the pointer is moved
on, without duplicating the table. Later, if a method is added, the
module's body and the include class will still have exactly the
same methods (figure 11).

!images/ch_class_symbolic.png(Include class)!

If you look closely at (A), the structure type flag is set to
T_ICLASS. This seems to be the mark of an include class. This
function's name is `include_class_new()` so `ICLASS`'s `I` must be
`include`.

And if you think about joining what this function and
`rb_include_module()` do, we know that our previous expectations were not
wrong. In brief, including is inserting the include class of a
module between a class and its superclass (figure 12).

!images/ch_class_include.png(Include)!

At (D-2) the module is stored in the include class's `klass`. At
(D-1), the module's body is taken out... at least that's what I'd like
to say, but in fact this check does not have any use. The `T_ICLASS`
check is already done at the beginning of this function, so when
arriving here there can't still be a `T_ICLASS`. Modification to
`ruby` piled up at a fast pace during quite a long period of time so
there are quite a few small overlooks.

There is one more thing to consider. Somehow the include class's
`basic.klass` is only used to point to the module's body, so for
example calling a method on the include class would be very bad. So
include classes must not be seen from Ruby programs. And in
practice all methods skip include classes, with no exception.

h3. Simulation

It was complicated so let's look at a concrete example. I'd like you
to look at figure 13 (1). We have the `c1` class and the `m1` module
that includes `m2`. From there, the changes made to include `m1` in
`c1` are (2) and (3). `im`s are of course include classes.

!images/ch_class_simulate.png(Include)!

h3. `rb_include_module` (2)

Well, now we can explain the part of `rb_include_module()` we skipped.

▼ `rb_include_module` (avoiding double inclusion)
<pre class="longlist">
 378  /* (A) skip if the superclass already includes module */
 379  for (p = RCLASS(klass)->super; p; p = RCLASS(p)->super) {
 380      switch (BUILTIN_TYPE(p)) {
 381        case T_ICLASS:
 382          if (RCLASS(p)->m_tbl == RCLASS(module)->m_tbl) {
 383              if (!superclass_seen) {
 384                  c = p;  /* the inserting point is moved */
 385              }
 386              goto skip;
 387          }
 388          break;
 389        case T_CLASS:
 390          superclass_seen = Qtrue;
 391          break;
 392      }
 393  }

(class.c)
</pre>

If one of the `T_ICLASS`es (include classes) that are in `klass`'s
superclasses (`p`) has the same table as one of the modules we want to
include (`module`), it's an include class for `module`. That's why we
skip the inclusion to not include the module twice. If this module
includes an other module (`module->super`), we check this once more.

However, when we skip an inclusion, `p` is a module that has been
included once, so its included modules must already be
included... that's what I thought for a moment, but we can have the
following context:

<pre class="emlist">
module M
end
module M2
end
class C
  include M   # M2 is not yet included in M
end           # therefore M2 is not in C's superclasses

module M
  include M2  # as there M2 is included in M,
end
class C
  include M   # I would like here to only add M2
end
</pre>

So on the contrary, there are cases for which `include` does not have
real-time repercussions.

For class inheritance, the class's singleton methods were inherited
but in the case of module there is no such thing. Therefore the
singleton methods of the module are not inherited by the including
class (or module). When you want to also inherit singleton methods,
the usual way is to override `Module#append_features`.
