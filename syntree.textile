h1(#chapter). Chapter 12: Syntax tree construction

h2. Node


h3. @NODE@


As I've already described, a Ruby program is first converted to a syntax tree.
To be more precise, a syntax tree is a tree structure made of structs called "nodes".
In @ruby@ , all nodes are of type @NODE@ .


<p class="caption">▼ @NODE@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 128  typedef struct RNode {
 129      unsigned long flags;
 130      char *nd_file;
 131      union {
 132          struct RNode *node;
 133          ID id;
 134          VALUE value;
 135          VALUE (*cfunc)(ANYARGS);
 136          ID *tbl;
 137      } u1;
 138      union {
 139          struct RNode *node;
 140          ID id;
 141          int argc;
 142          VALUE value;
 143      } u2;
 144      union {
 145          struct RNode *node;
 146          ID id;
 147          long state;
 148          struct global_entry *entry;
 149          long cnt;
 150          VALUE value;
 151      } u3;
 152  } NODE;

(node.h)
</pre>


Although you might be able to infer from the struct name @RNode@ , nodes are Ruby objects.
This means the creation and release of nodes are taken care of by the @ruby@ 's garbage collector.


Therefore, @flags@ naturally has the same role as @basic.flags@ of the object struct.
It means that @T_NODE@ which is the type of a struct and flags such as @FL_FREEZE@ are stored in it.
As for @NODE@ , in addition to these, its node type is stored in @flags@ .


What does it mean? Since a program could contain various elements
such as @if@ and @while@ and @def@ and so on, there are also various corresponding node types.
The three available union are complicated,
but how these unions are used is decided to only one specific way for each node.
For example, the below table shows the case when it is @NODE_IF@ that is the node of @if@ .


|_. member |_. union member |_. role |
| @u1@ | @u1.node@ | the condition expression |
| @u2@ | @u2.node@ | the body of true |
| @u3@ | @u3.node@ | the body of false |


And, in @node.h@ , the macros to access each union member are available.


<p class="caption">▼ the macros to access @NODE@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 166  #define nd_head  u1.node
 167  #define nd_alen  u2.argc
 168  #define nd_next  u3.node
 169
 170  #define nd_cond  u1.node
 171  #define nd_body  u2.node
 172  #define nd_else  u3.node
 173
 174  #define nd_orig  u3.value
                 ：
                 ：

(node.h)
</pre>


For example, these are used as follows:


<pre class="emlist">
NODE *head, *tail;
head->nd_next = tail;    /* head->u3.node = tail */
</pre>


In the source code, it's almost certain that these macros are used.
A very few exceptions are only the two places where creating @NODE@ in @parse.y@
and where marking @NODE@ in @gc.c@ .


By the way, what is the reason why such macros are used?
For one thing, it might be because it's cumbersome to remember numbers like @u1@
that are not meaningful by just themselves.
But what is more important than that is, there should be no problem if the
corresponding number is changed and it's possible that it will actually be changed.
For example, since a condition clause of @if@ does not have to be stored in @u1@ ,
someone might want to change it to @u2@ for some reason. But if @u1@ is directly used,
he needs to modify a lot of places all over the source codes, it is inconvenient.
Since nodes are all declared as @NODE@ , it's hard to find nodes that represent @if@ .
By preparing the macros to access, this kind of trouble can be avoided
and conversely we can determine the node types from the macros.



h3. Node Type


I said that in the @flags@ of a @NODE@ struct its node type is stored.
We'll look at in what form this information is stored.
A node type can be set by @nd_set_type()@ and obtained by @nd_type()@ .


<p class="caption">▼ @nd_type nd_set_type@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 156  #define nd_type(n) (((RNODE(n))->flags>>FL_USHIFT)&0xff)
 157  #define nd_set_type(n,t) \
 158      RNODE(n)->flags = ((RNODE(n)->flags & ~FL_UMASK) \
                             | (((t)<<FL_USHIFT) & FL_UMASK))

(node.h)
</pre>


<p class="caption">▼ @FL_USHIFT FL_UMASK@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 418  #define FL_USHIFT    11
 429  #define FL_UMASK  (0xff<<FL_USHIFT)

(ruby.h)
</pre>


It won't be so much trouble if we'll keep focus on around @nd_type@ .
Fig.1 shows how it seems like.


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_flagUsage.jpg" alt="(flagUsage)"><br>
Fig.1: How RNode.flags is used
</p>


And, since macros cannot be used from debuggers,
the @nodetype()@ function is also available.


<p class="caption">▼ @nodetype@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
4247  static enum node_type
4248  nodetype(node)                  /* for debug */
4249      NODE *node;
4250  {
4251      return (enum node_type)nd_type(node);
4252  }

(parse.y)
</pre>




h3. File Name and Line Number


The @nd_file@ of a @NODE@ holds (the pointer to) the name of the file where the
text that corresponds to this node exists. Since there's the file name, we
naturally expect that there's also the line number, but the corresponding member
could not be found around here. Actually, the line number is being embedded to
@flags@ by the following macro:


<p class="caption">▼ @nd_line nd_set_line@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 160  #define NODE_LSHIFT (FL_USHIFT+8)
 161  #define NODE_LMASK  (((long)1<<(sizeof(NODE*)*CHAR_BIT-NODE_LSHIFT))-1)
 162  #define nd_line(n) \
          ((unsigned int)((RNODE(n)->flags >> NODE_LSHIFT) & NODE_LMASK))
 163  #define nd_set_line(n,l) \
 164      RNODE(n)->flags = ((RNODE(n)->flags & ~(-1 << NODE_LSHIFT)) \
                             | (((l)&NODE_LMASK) << NODE_LSHIFT))

(node.h)
</pre>


@nd_set_line()@ is fairly spectacular.
However, as the names suggest, it is certain that @nd_set_line()@ and @nd_line@
works symmetrically. Thus, if we first examine the simpler @nd_line()@ and grasp
the relationship between the parameters, there's no need to analyze @nd_set_line()@
in the first place.



The first thing is @NODE_LSHIFT@ , as you can guess from the description of the
node types of the previous section, it is the number of used bits in @flags@ .
@FL_USHIFT@ is reserved by system of @ruby@ (11 bits, @ruby.h@ ), 8 bits are for
its node type.


The next thing is @NODE_LMASK@ .



<pre class="emlist">
sizeof(NODE*) * CHAR_BIT - NODE_LSHIFT
</pre>


This is the number of the rest of the bits.
Let's assume it is  @restbits@ . This makes the code a lot simpler.



<pre class="emlist">
#define NODE_LMASK  (((long)1 << restbits) - 1)
</pre>


Fig.2 shows what the above code seems to be doing. Note that a borrow occurs
when subtracting 1. We can eventually understand that @NODE_LMASK@ is a sequence
filled with 1 whose size is the number of the bits that are still available.


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_lmask.jpg" alt="(lmask)"><br>
Fig.2: @NODE_LMASK@
</p>



Now, let's look at @nd_line()@ again.



<pre class="emlist">
(RNODE(n)->flags >> NODE_LSHIFT) & NODE_LMASK
</pre>


By the right shift, the unused space is shifted to the LSB. The bitwise AND
leaves only the unused space. Fig.3 shows how @flags@ is used. Since @FL_USHIFT@
is 11, in 32-bit machine 32-(11+8)=13 bits are available for the line number.


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_flags.jpg" alt="(flags)"><br>
Fig.3: How @flags@ are used at @NODE@
</p>


... This means, if the line numbers becomes beyond 2^13=8192,
the line numbers should wrongly be displayed. Let's try.



<pre class="emlist">
File.open('overflow.rb', 'w') {|f|
    10000.times { f.puts }
    f.puts 'raise'
}
</pre>


With my 686 machine, @ruby overflow.rb@ properly displayed 1809 as a line number.
I've succeeded. However, if you use 64-bit machine, you need to create a little
bigger file in order to successfully fail.




h3. @rb_node_newnode()@


Lastly let's look at the function @rb_node_newnode()@ that creates a node.


<p class="caption">▼ @rb_node_newnode()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
4228  NODE*
4229  rb_node_newnode(type, a0, a1, a2)
4230      enum node_type type;
4231      NODE *a0, *a1, *a2;
4232  {
4233      NODE *n = (NODE*)rb_newobj();
4234
4235      n->flags |= T_NODE;
4236      nd_set_type(n, type);
4237      nd_set_line(n, ruby_sourceline);
4238      n->nd_file = ruby_sourcefile;
4239
4240      n->u1.node = a0;
4241      n->u2.node = a1;
4242      n->u3.node = a2;
4243
4244      return n;
4245  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


We've seen @rb_newobj()@ in the Chapter 5: Garbage collection. It is the function to get a
vacant @RVALUE@ . By attaching the @T_NODE@ struct-type flag to it,
the initialization as a @VALUE@ will complete.
Of course, it's possible that some values that are not of type @NODE*@ are
passed for @u1 u2 u3@, but received as @NODE*@ for the time being.
Since the syntax trees of @ruby@ does not contain @double@ and such,
if the values are received as pointers, it will never be too small in size.


For the rest part, you can forget about the details you've learned so far,
and assume @NODE@ is


* @flags@
* @nodetype@
* @nd_line@
* @nd_file@
* @u1@
* @u2@
* @u3@


a struct type that has the above seven members.





h2. Syntax Tree Construction


The role of the parser is to convert the source code that is a byte sequence to a
syntax tree. Although the grammar passed, it does not finish even half of the task,
so we have to assemble nodes and create a tree.
In this section, we'll look at the construction process of that syntax tree.




h3. @YYSTYPE@


Essentially this chapter is about actions,
thus @YYSTYPE@ which is the type of @$$@ or @$1@ becomes important.
Let's look at the @%union@ of @ruby@ first.


<p class="caption">▼ @%union@  declaration</p>

<pre class="longlist">
 170  %union {
 171      NODE *node;
 172      ID id;
 173      int num;
 174      struct RVarmap *vars;
 175  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


@struct RVarmap@ is a struct used by the evaluator and holds a block local variable.
You can tell the rest. The most used one is of course @node@ .




h3. Landscape with Syntax Trees


I mentioned that looking at the fact first is a theory of code reading.
Since what we want to know this time is how the generated syntax tree is,
we should start with looking at the answer (the syntax tree).


It's also nice using debuggers to observe every time,
but you can visualize the syntax tree more handily
by using the tool @nodedump@ contained in the attached CD-ROM,
This tool is originally the NodeDump made by "Pragmatic Programmers":http://www.pragmaticprogrammers.com
and remodeled for this book.
The original version shows quite explanatory output,
but this remodeled version deeply and directly displays the appearance of the
syntax tree.


For example, in order to dump the simple expression @m(a)@ , you can do as follows:



<pre class="screen">
% ruby -rnodedump -e 'm(a)'
NODE_NEWLINE
nd_file = "-e"
nd_nth  = 1
nd_next:
    NODE_FCALL
    nd_mid = 9617 (m)
    nd_args:
        NODE_ARRAY
        nd_alen = 1
        nd_head:
            NODE_VCALL
            nd_mid = 9625 (a)
        nd_next = (null)
</pre>


The @-r@ option is used to specify the library to be load,
and the @-e@ is used to pass a program.
Then, the syntax tree expression of the program will be dumped.


I'll briefly explain about how to see the content.
@NODE_NEWLINE@ and @NODE_FCALL@ and such are the node types.
What are written at the same indent level of each node are the contents of its node members.
For example, the root is @NODE_NEWLINE@ , and it has the three members:
@nd_file nd_nth nd_next@. @nd_file@ points to the @"-e"@ string of C,
and @ng_nth@ points to the 1 integer of C, and @nd_next@ holds the next node @NODE_CALL@ .
But since these explanation in text are probably not intuitive,
I recommend you to also check Fig.4 at the same time.


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_stree.jpg" alt="(stree)"><br>
Fig.4: Syntax Tree
</p>


I'll explain the meaning of each node. @NODE_CALL@ is a Function CALL.
@NODE_ARRAY@ is as its name suggests the node of array, and here it expresses
the list of arguments. @NODE_VCALL@ is a Variable or CALL, a reference to
undefined local variable will become this.


Then, what is @NODE_NEWLINE@ ? This is the node to join the name of the currently
executed file and the line number at runtime and is set for each @stmt@ .
Therefore, when only thinking about the meaning of the execution, this node can
be ignored. When you @require@ @nodedump-short@ instead of @nodedump@ ,
distractions like @NODE_NEWLINE@ are left out in the first place. Since it is
easier to see if it is simple, @nodedump-short@ will be used later on except for
when particularly written.



Now, we'll look at the three type of composing elements in order to grasp how
the whole syntax tree is. The first one is the leaves of a syntax tree. Next,
we'll look at expressions that are combinations of that leaves, this means they
are branches of a syntax tree.
The last one is the list to list up the statements that is the trunk of a syntax
tree in other words.




h3. Leaf


First, let's start with the edges that are the leaves of the syntax tree.
Literals and variable references and so on, among the rules, they are what
belong to @primary@ and are particularly simple even among the @primary@ rules.



<pre class="screen">
% ruby -rnodedump-short -e '1'
NODE_LIT
nd_lit = 1:Fixnum
</pre>


1 as a numeric value. There's not any twist. However, notice that what is
stored in the node is not 1 of C but 1 of Ruby (1 of @Fixnum@ ). This is because ...



<pre class="screen">
% ruby -rnodedump-short -e ':sym'
NODE_LIT
nd_lit = 9617:Symbol
</pre>


This way, @Symbol@ is represented by the same @NODE_LIT@ when it becomes a syntax tree.
As the above example, @VALUE@ is always stored in @nd_lit@ so it can be handled
completely in the same way whether it is a @Symbol@ or a @Fixnum@ when executing.
In this way, all we need to do when dealing with it are retrieving the value
in @nd_lit@ and returning it. Since we create a syntax tree in order to execute it,
designing it so that it becomes convenient when executing is the right thing to do.





<pre class="screen">
% ruby -rnodedump-short -e '"a"'
NODE_STR
nd_lit = "a":String
</pre>


A string. This is also a Ruby string.
String literals are copied when actually used.



<pre class="screen">
% ruby -rnodedump -e '[0,1]'
NODE_NEWLINE
nd_file = "-e"
nd_nth  = 1
nd_next:
    NODE_ARRAY
    nd_alen = 2
    nd_head:
        NODE_LIT
        nd_lit = 0:Fixnum
    nd_next:
        NODE_ARRAY
        nd_alen = 1
        nd_head:
            NODE_LIT
            nd_lit = 1:Fixnum
        nd_next = (null)
</pre>


Array. I can't say this is a leaf, but let's allow this to be here because it's
also a literal. It seems like a list of @NODE_ARRAY@ hung with each element node.
The reason why only in this case I didn't use @nodedump-short@ is ...
you will understand after finishing to read this section.




h3. Branch


Next, we'll focus on "combinations" that are branches.
@if@ will be taken as an example.


h4. @if@


I feel like @if@ is always used as an example, that's because its structure is
simple and there's not any reader who don't know about @if@ , so it is convenient
for writers.


Anyway, this is an example of @if@ .
For example, let's convert this code to a syntax tree.


<p class="caption">▼The Source Program</p>

<pre class="longlist">
if true
  'true expr'
else
  'false expr'
end
</pre>


<p class="caption">▼Its syntax tree expression</p>

<pre class="longlist">
NODE_IF
nd_cond:
    NODE_TRUE
nd_body:
    NODE_STR
    nd_lit = "true expr":String
nd_else:
    NODE_STR
    nd_lit = "false expr":String
</pre>


Here, the previously described @nodedump-short@ is used, so @NODE_NEWLINE@
disappeared. @nd_cond@ is the condition, @nd_body@ is the body of the true case,
@nd_else@ is the body of the false case.



Then, let's look at the code to build this.


<p class="caption">▼ @if@  rule</p>

<pre class="longlist">
1373                  | kIF expr_value then
1374                    compstmt
1375                    if_tail
1376                    kEND
1377                      {
1378                          $$ = NEW_IF(cond($2), $4, $5);
1379                          fixpos($$, $2);
1380                      }

(parse.y)
</pre>


It seems that @NEW_IF()@ is the macro to create @NODE_IF@ . Among the values of
the symbols, @$2 $4 $5@ are used, thus the correspondences between the symbols
of the rule and @$n@ are:




<pre class="emlist">
kIF    expr_value  then  compstmt  if_tail  kEND
 $1          $2      $3        $4       $5    $6
NEW_IF(expr_value,       compstmt, if_tail)
</pre>


this way. In other words, @expr_value@ is the condition expression, @compstmt@
( @$4@ ) is the case of true, @if_tail@ is the case of false.


On the other hand, the macros to create nodes are all named @NEW_xxxx@ , and they
are defined @node.h@ . Let's look at @NEW_IF()@ .



<p class="caption">▼ @NEW_IF()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 243  #define NEW_IF(c,t,e) rb_node_newnode(NODE_IF,c,t,e)

(node.h)
</pre>


As for the parameters,
it seems that @c@ represents condition, @t@ represents then, and @e@ represents
else respectively. As described at the previous section, the order of
members of a node is not so meaningful, so you don't need to be careful about
parameter names in this kind of place.


And, the @code()@ which processes the node of the condition expression in the
action is a semantic analysis function. This will be described later.


Additionally, @fixpos()@ corrects the line number. @NODE@ is initialized with
the file name and the line number of the time when it is "created". However,
for instance, the code of @if@ should already be parsed by @end@ by the time
when creating @NODE_IF@ . Thus, the line number would go wrong if it remains
untouched. Therefore, it needs to be corrected by @fixpos()@ .



<pre class="emlist">
fixpos(dest, src)
</pre>


This way, the line number of the node @dest@ is set to the one of the node @src@ .
As for @if@ , the line number of the condition expression becomes the line number
of the whole @if@ expression.





h4. @elsif@


Subsequently, let's look at the rule of @if_tail@ .


<p class="caption">▼ @if_tail@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
1543  if_tail         : opt_else
1544                  | kELSIF expr_value then
1545                    compstmt
1546                    if_tail
1547                      {
1548                          $$ = NEW_IF(cond($2), $4, $5);
1549                          fixpos($$, $2);
1550                      }

1553  opt_else        : none
1554                  | kELSE compstmt
1555                      {
1556                          $$ = $2;
1557                      }

(parse.y)
</pre>


First, this rule expresses "a list ends with @opt_else@ after zero or more
number of @elsif@ clauses". That's because, @if_tail@ appears again and again
while @elsif@ continues, it disappears when @opt_else@ comes in. We can
understand this by extracting arbitrary times.



<pre class="emlist">
if_tail: kELSIF .... if_tail
if_tail: kELSIF .... kELSIF .... if_tail
if_tail: kELSIF .... kELSIF .... kELSIF .... if_tail
if_tail: kELSIF .... kELSIF .... kELSIF .... opt_else
if_tail: kELSIF .... kELSIF .... kELSIF .... kELSE compstmt
</pre>


Next, let's focus on the actions, surprisingly, @elsif@ uses the same @NEW_IF()@ as @if@ .
It means, the below two programs will lose the difference after they become syntax trees.



<pre class="emlist">
if cond1                  if cond1
  body1                     body1
elsif cond2               else
  body2                     if cond2
elsif cond3                   body2
  body3                     else
else                          if cond3
  body4                         body3
end                           else
                                body4
                              end
                            end
                          end
</pre>


Come to think of it, in C language and such, there's no distinction between
the two also at the syntax level. Thus this might be a matter of course.
Alternatively, the conditional operator ( @a?b:c@ ) becomes indistinguishable
from @if@ statement after they become syntax trees.


The precedences was very meaningful when it was in the context of grammar,
but they become unnecessary any more because the structure of a syntax tree
contains that information. And, the difference in appearance such as @if@ and
the conditional operator become completely meaningless,
its meaning (its behavior) only matters.
Therefore, there's perfectly no problem if @if@ and the conditional operator
are the same in its syntax tree expression.


I'll introduce a few more examples. @add@ and @&&@ become the same.
@or@ and @||@ are also equal to each other. @not@ and @!@ , @if@ and modifier @if@ ,
and so on. These pairs also become equal to each other.




h4. Left Recursive and Right Recursive


By the way, the symbol of a list was always written at the left side when expressing a list
in Chapter 9: yacc crash course. However, have you noticed it becomes opposite in @if_tail@ ?
I'll show only the crucial part again.



<pre class="emlist">
if_tail: opt_else
       | kELSIF ... if_tail
</pre>


Surely, it is opposite of the previous examples. @if_tail@ which is the symbol
of a list is at the right side.


In fact, there's another established way of expressing lists,



<pre class="emlist">
list: END_ITEM
    | ITEM list
</pre>


when you write in this way, it becomes the list that contains continuous zero
or more number of @ITEM@ and ends with @END_ITEM@ .


As an expression of a list, whichever is used it does not create a so much difference,
but the way that the actions are executed is fatally different.
With the form that @list@ is written at the right, the actions are sequentially
executed from the last @ITEM@ . We've already learned about the behavior of the
stack of when @list@ is at the left,
so let's try the case that @list@ is at the right.
The input is 4 @ITEM@ s and @END_ITEM@ .


| | empty at first |
| @ITEM@ | shift @ITEM@ |
| @ITEM ITEM@ | shift @ITEM@ |
| @ITEM ITEM ITEM@ | shift @ITEM@ |
| @ITEM ITEM ITEM ITEM@ | shift @ITEM@ |
| @ITEM ITEM ITEM ITEM END_ITEM@ | shift @END_ITEM@ |
| @ITEM ITEM ITEM ITEM list@ | reduce @END_ITEM@ to @list@ |
| @ITEM ITEM ITEM list@ | reduce @ITEM list@ to @list@ |
| @ITEM ITEM list@ | reduce @ITEM list@ to @list@ |
| @ITEM list@ | reduce @ITEM list@ to @list@ |
| @list@ | reduce @ITEM list@ to @list@ |
| | accept. |


When @list@ was at the left, shifts and reductions were done in turns.
This time, as you see, there are continuous shifts and continuous reductions.


The reason why @if_tail@ places "@list@ at the right" is to create a syntax tree
from the bottom up. When creating from the bottom up, the node of @if@ will be
left in hand in the end. But if defining @if_tail@ by placing "@list@ at the left",
in order to eventually leave the node of @if@ in hand, it needs to traverse all
links of the @elsif@ and every time @elsif@
is found add it to the end. This is cumbersome. And, slow.
Thus, @if_tail@ is constructed in the "@list@ at the right" manner.


Finally, the meaning of the headline is, in grammar terms,
"the left is @list@ " is called left-recursive,
"the right is @list@ " is called right-recursive.
These terms are used mainly when reading papers about processing grammars or
writing a book of @yacc@ .




h3. Trunk


Leaf, branch, and finally, it's trunk.
Let's look at how the list of statements are joined.


<p class="caption">▼The Source Program</p>

<pre class="longlist">
7
8
9
</pre>


The dump of the corresponding syntax tree is shown below.
This is not @nodedump-short@ but in the perfect form.


<p class="caption">▼Its Syntax Tree</p>

<pre class="longlist">
NODE_BLOCK
nd_head:
    NODE_NEWLINE
    nd_file = "multistmt"
    nd_nth  = 1
    nd_next:
        NODE_LIT
        nd_lit = 7:Fixnum
nd_next:
    NODE_BLOCK
    nd_head:
        NODE_NEWLINE
        nd_file = "multistmt"
        nd_nth  = 2
        nd_next:
            NODE_LIT
            nd_lit = 8:Fixnum
    nd_next:
        NODE_BLOCK
        nd_head:
            NODE_NEWLINE
            nd_file = "multistmt"
            nd_nth  = 3
            nd_next:
                NODE_LIT
                nd_lit = 9:Fixnum
        nd_next = (null)
</pre>


We can see the list of @NODE_BLOCK@ is created and @NODE_NEWLINE@ are attached
as headers. (Fig.5)


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_blocklist.jpg" alt="(blocklist)"><br>
Fig.5: @NODE_BLOCK@ and @NODE_NEWLINE@
</p>


It means, for each statement ( @stmt@ ) @NODE_NEWLINE@ is attached,
and when they are multiple, it will be a list of @NODE_BLOCK@ .
Let's also see the code.


<p class="caption">▼ @stmts@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 354  stmts           : none
 355                  | stmt
 356                      {
 357                          $$ = newline_node($1);
 358                      }
 359                  | stmts terms stmt
 360                      {
 361                          $$ = block_append($1, newline_node($3));
 362                      }

(parse.y)
</pre>


@newline_node()@ caps @NODE_NEWLINE@ , @block_append()@ appends it to the list.
It's straightforward.
Let's look at the content only of the @block_append()@ .




h4. @block_append()@


It this function, the error checks are in the very middle and obstructive.
Thus I'll show the code without that part.


<p class="caption">▼ @block_append()@  (omitted)</p>

<pre class="longlist">
4285  static NODE*
4286  block_append(head, tail)
4287      NODE *head, *tail;
4288  {
4289      NODE *end;
4290
4291      if (tail == 0) return head;
4292      if (head == 0) return tail;
4293
4294      if (nd_type(head) != NODE_BLOCK) {
4295          end = NEW_BLOCK(head);
4296          end->nd_end = end;    /*（A-1）*/
4297          fixpos(end, head);
4298          head = end;
4299      }
4300      else {
4301          end = head->nd_end;   /*（A-2）*/
4302      }

          /* ……omitted…… */

4325      if (nd_type(tail) != NODE_BLOCK) {
4326          tail = NEW_BLOCK(tail);
4327          tail->nd_end = tail;
4328      }
4329      end->nd_next = tail;
4330      head->nd_end = tail->nd_end;   /*（A-3）*/
4331      return head;
4332  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


According to the previous syntax tree dump, @NEW_BLOCK@ was a linked list uses @nd_next@ .
Being aware of it while reading, it can be read "if either @head@ or @tail@ is not @NODE_BLOCK@ ,
wrap it with @NODE_BLOCK@ and join the lists each other."


Additionally, on (A-1~3), the @nd_end@ of the @NODE_BLOCK@ of the head of the
list always points to the @NODE_BLOCK@ of the tail of the list. This is probably
because in this way we don't have to traverse all elements when adding an
element to the tail (Fig.6).
Conversely speaking, when you need to add elements later, @NODE_BLOCK@ is suitable.

h3. The two types of lists


Now, I've explained the outline so far.
Because the structure of syntax tree will also appear in Part 3 in large amounts,
we won't go further as long as we are in Part 2.
But before ending, there's one more thing I'd like to talk about.
It is about the two general-purpose lists.


The two general-purpose lists mean @BLOCK@ and @LIST@ .
@BLOCK@ is, as previously described, a linked list of @NODE_BLOCK@ to join the statements.
@LIST@ is, although it is called @LIST@ , a list of @NODE_ARRAY@ .
This is what is used for array literals.
@LIST@ is used to store the arguments of a method or the list of multiple assignments.


As for the difference between the two lists,
looking at the usage of the nodes is helpful to understand.


| @NODE_BLOCK@ | @nd_head@ | holding an element |
|              | @nd_end@  | pointing to the @NODE_BLOCK@ of the end of the list |
|              | @nd_next@ | pointing to the next @NODE_BLOCK@ |
| @NODE_ARRAY@ | @nd_head@ | holding an element |
|              | @nd_alen@ | the length of the list that follows this node |
|              | @nd_next@ | pointing to the next @NODE_ARRAY@ |


The usage differs only in the second elements that are @nd_end@ and @nd_alen@ .
And this is exactly the significance of the existence of each type of the two nodes.
Since its size can be stored in @NODE_ARRAY@ , we use an @ARRAY@ list
when the size of the list will frequently be required.
Otherwise, we use a @BLOCK@ list that is very fast to join.
I don't describe this topic in details because the codes that use them is
necessary to understand the significance but not shown here,
but when the codes appear in Part 3,
I'd like you to recall this and think "Oh, this uses the length".




h2. Semantic Analysis


As I briefly mentioned at the beginning of Part 2, there are two types of analysis
that are appearance analysis and semantic analysis.
The appearance analysis is mostly done by @yacc@ , the rest is doing the semantic
analysis inside actions.




h3. Errors inside actions


What does the semantic analysis precisely mean?
For example, there are type checks in a language that has types.
Alternatively, check if variables with the same name are not defined multiple times,
and check if variables are not used before their definitions,
and check if the procedure being used is defined,
and check if @return@ is not used outside of procedures, and so on.
These are part of the semantic analysis.


What kind of semantic analysis is done in the current @ruby@ ?
Since the error checks occupies almost all of semantic analysis in @ruby@ ,
searching the places where generating errors seems a good way.
In a parser of @yacc@ , @yyerror()@ is supposed to be called when an error occurs.
Conversely speaking, there's an error where @yyerror()@ exists.
So, I made a list of the places where calling @yyerror()@ inside the actions.


* an expression not having its value (void value expression) at a place where a value is required
* an @alias@ of @$n@
* @BEGIN@ inside of a method
* @END@ inside of a method
* @return@ outside of methods
* a local variable at a place where constant is required
* a @class@ statement inside of a method
* an invalid parameter variable (@$gvar@ and @CONST@ and such)
* parameters with the same name appear twice
* an invalid receiver of a singleton method (@def ().method@ and such)
* a singleton method definition on literals
* an odd number of a list for hash literals
* an assignment to @self/nil/true/false/__FILE__/__LINE__@
* a constant assignment inside of a method
* a multiple assignment inside of a conditional expression


These checks can roughly be categorized by each purpose as follows:


* for the better error message
* in order not to make the rule too complex
* the others (pure semantic analysis)


For example, "@return@ outside of a method" is a check in order not to make the
rule too complex. Since this error is a problem of the structure, it can be
dealt with by grammar.
For example, it's possible by defining the rules separately for both inside and
outside of methods and making the list of all what are allowed and what are not
allowed respectively. But this is in any way cumbersome and rejecting it in an
action is far more concise.


And, "an assignment to @self@ " seems a check for the better error message.
In comparison to "@return@ outside of methods", rejecting it by grammar is much easier,
but if it is rejected by the parser, the output would be just @"parse error"@.
Comparing to it, the current



<pre class="screen">
% ruby -e 'self = 1'
-e:1: Can't change the value of self
self = 1
      ^
</pre>

this error is much more friendly.


Of course, we can not always say that an arbitrary rule is exactly "for this purpose".
For example, as for "@return@ outside of methods",
this can also be considered that this is a check "for the better error message".
The purposes are overlapping each other.


Now, the problem is "a pure semantic analysis",
in Ruby there are few things belong to this category.
In the case of a typed language, the type analysis is a big event, but
because variables are not typed in Ruby, it is meaningless.
What is standing out instead is the cheek of an expression that has its value.



To put "having its value" precisely,
it is "you can obtain a value as a result of evaluating it".
@return@ and @break@ do not have values by themselves. Of course, a value is
passed to the place where @return@ to, but not any values are left at the place
where @return@ is written.
Therefore, for example, the next expression is odd,



<pre class="emlist">
i = return(1)
</pre>


Since this kind of expressions are clearly due to misunderstanding or simple mistakes,
it's better to reject when compiling.
Next, we'll look at @value_expr@ which is one of the functions to check if it takes a value.


h3. @value_expr()@


@value_expr()@ is the function to check if it is an @expr@ that has a value.


<p class="caption">▼ @value_expr()@ </p>

h4. Algorithm

Summary: It sequentially checks the nodes of the tree, if it hits "an expression
certainly not having its value", it means the tree does not have any value.
Then it warns about that by using @rb_warning()@ and return @Qfalse@ . If it
finishes to traverse the entire tree without hitting any "an expression not
having its value", it means the tree does have a value. Thus it returns @Qtrue@ .


Here, notice that it does not always need to check the whole tree.
For example, let's assume @value_expr()@ is called on the argument of a method.
Here:


<p class="caption">▼ check the value of  @arg@  by using  @value_expr()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
1055  arg_value       : arg
1056                      {
1057                          value_expr($1);
1058                          $$ = $1;
1059                      }

(parse.y)
</pre>


Inside of this argument @$1@ , there can also be other nesting method calls again.
But, the argument of the inside method must have been already checked with
@value_expr()@ , so you don't have to check it again.


Let's think more generally. Assume an arbitrary grammar element @A@ exists,
and assume @value_expr()@ is called against its all composing elements,
the necessity to check the element @A@ again would disappear.


Then, for example, how is @if@ ? Is it possible to be handled as if @value_expr()@
has already called for all elements? If I put only the bottom line, it isn't.
That is because, since @if@ is a statement (which does not use a value),
the main body should not have to return a value.
For example, in the next case:



<pre class="emlist">
def method
  if true
    return 1
  else
    return 2
  end
  5
end
</pre>

This @if@ statement does not need a value.<br>
But in the next case, its value is necessary.



<pre class="emlist">
def method( arg )
  tmp = if arg
        then 3
        else 98
        end
  tmp * tmp / 3.5
end
</pre>


So, in this case, the @if@ statement must be checked when checking the entire
assignment expression. This kind of things are laid out in the @switch@
statement of @value_expr()@ .




h4. Removing Tail Recursion


By the way, when looking over the whole @value_expr@ , we can see that there's
the following pattern appears frequently:



<pre class="emlist">
while (node) {
    switch (nd_type(node)) {
      case NODE_XXXX:
        node = node->nd_xxxx;
        break;
         ：
         ：
    }
}
</pre>


This expression will also carry the same meaning after being modified to the below:



<pre class="emlist">
return value_expr(node->nd_xxxx)
</pre>


A code like this which does a recursive call just before @return@ is called a
tail recursion. It is known that this can generally be converted to @goto@ .
This method is often used when optimizing.
As for Scheme, it is defined in specifications that tail recursions must be
removed by language processors. This is because recursions are often used
instead of loops in Lisp-like languages.


However, be careful that tail recursions are only when "calling just before @return@ ".
For example, take a look at the @NODE_IF@ of @value_expr()@ ,



<pre class="emlist">
if (!value_expr(node->nd_body)) return Qfalse;
node = node->nd_else;
break;
</pre>


As shown above, the first time is a recursive call.
Rewriting this to the form of using @return@ ,



<pre class="emlist">
return value_expr(node->nd_body) && value_expr(node->nd_else);
</pre>


If the left @value_expr()@ is false, the right @value_expr()@ is also executed.
In this case, the left @value_expr()@ is not "just before" @return@ .
Therefore, it is not a tail recursion.
Hence, it can't be extracted to @goto@ .




h3. The whole picture of the value check


As for value checks, we won't read the functions further.
You might think it's too early, but all of the other functions are, as the same
as @value_expr()@ , step-by-step one-by-one only traversing and checking nodes,
so they are completely not interesting.
However, I'd like to cover the whole picture at least,
so I finish this section by just showing the call graph of the relevant functions (Fig.7).


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_callgraph.jpg" alt="(callgraph)"><br>
Fig.7: the call graph of the value check functions
</p>






h2. Local Variables


h3. Local Variable Definitions


The variable definitions in Ruby are really various.
As for constants and class variables, these are defined on the first assignment.
As for instance variables and global variables, as all names can be considered
that they are already defined, you can refer them without assigning beforehand
(although it produces warnings).



The definitions of local variables are again completely different from the above all.
A local variable is defined when its assignment appears on the program.
For example, as follows:



<pre class="emlist">
lvar = nil
p lvar      # being defined
</pre>


In this case, as the assignment to @lvar@ is written at the first line,
in this moment @lvar@ is defined.
When it is undefined, it ends up with a runtime exception @NameError@ as follows:



<pre class="emlist">
% ruby lvar.rb
lvar.rb:1: undefined local variable or method `lvar'
for #<Object:0x40163a9c> (NameError)
</pre>


Why does it say @"local variable or method"@?
As for methods, the parentheses of the arguments can be omitted when calling,
so when there's not any arguments, it can't be distinguished from local variables.
To resolve this situation, @ruby@ tries to call it as a method  when it finds
an undefined local variable. Then if the corresponding method is not found, it
generates an error such as the above one.


By the way, it is defined when "it appears", this means it is defined even
though it was not assigned. The initial value of a defined variable is nil.



<pre class="emlist">
if false
  lvar = "this assigment will never be executed"
end
p lvar   # shows nil
</pre>


Moreover, since it is defined "when" it "appears", the definition has to be
before the reference in a symbol sequence.
For example, in the next case, it is not defined.



<pre class="emlist">
p lvar       # not defined !
lvar = nil   # although appearing here ...
</pre>


Be careful about the point of "in the symbol sequence".
It has completely nothing to do with the order of evaluations.
For example, for the next code, naturally the condition expression is evaluated first,
but in the symbol sequence, at the moment when @p@ appears the assignment
to @lvar@ has not appeared yet.
Therefore, this produces @NameError@ .



<pre class="emlist">
p(lvar) if lvar = true
</pre>


What we've learned by now is that the local variables are extremely influenced
by the appearances. When a symbol sequence that expresses an assignment appears,
it will be defined in the appearance order. Based on this information, we can
infer that @ruby@ seems to define local variables while parsing because the
order of the symbol sequence does not exist after leaving the parser.
And in fact, it is true. In @ruby@ , the parser defines local variables.




h3. Block Local Variables


The local variables newly defined in an iterator block are called block local
variables or dynamic variables. Block local variables are, in language
specifications, identical to local variables. However, these two differ in
their implementations.
We'll look at how is the difference from now on.




h3. The data structure


We'll start with the local variable table @struct local_vars@.


<p class="caption">▼ @struct local_vars@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5174  static struct local_vars {
5175      ID *tbl;                    /* the table of local variable names */
5176      int nofree;                 /* whether it is used from outside */
5177      int cnt;                    /* the size of the tbl array */
5178      int dlev;                   /* the nesting level of dyna_vars */
5179      struct RVarmap* dyna_vars;  /* block local variable names */
5180      struct local_vars *prev;
5181  } *lvtbl;

(parse.y)
</pre>


The member name @prev@ indicates that the @struct local_vars@ is a
opposite-direction linked list. ... Based on this, we can expect a stack.
The simultaneously declared global variable @lvtbl@ points to @local_vars@ that
is the top of that stack.


And, @struct RVarmap@ is defined in @env.h@ ,
and is available to other files and is also used by the evaluator.
This is used to store the block local variables.


<p class="caption">▼ @struct RVarmap@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
  52  struct RVarmap {
  53      struct RBasic super;
  54      ID id;                  /* the variable name */
  55      VALUE val;              /* its value */
  56      struct RVarmap *next;
  57  };

(env.h)
</pre>



Since there's @struct RBasic@ at the top, this is a Ruby object.
It means it is managed by the garbage collector.
And since it is joined by the @next@ member, it is probably a linked list.


Based on the observation we've done and the information that will be explained,
Fig.8 illustrates the image of both structs while executing the parser.

h3. Local Variable Scope


When looking over the list of function names of @parse.y@ ,
we can find functions such as @local_push() local_pop() local_cnt()@ are laid out.
In whatever way of thinking, they appear to be relating to a local variable.
Moreover, because the names are @push pop@, it is clearly a stack.
So first, let's find out the places where using these functions.


<p class="caption">▼ @local_push() local_pop()@  used examples</p>

<pre class="longlist">
1475                  | kDEF fname

1478                          cur_mid = $2;
1479                          in_def++;
1480                          local_push(0);
1481                      }
1482                    f_arglist

1487                          $$ = NEW_DEFN($2, $4, $5,
                                  class_nest?NOEX_PUBLIC:NOEX_PRIVATE);
1488                          if (is_attrset_id($2))
                                  $$->nd_noex = NOEX_PUBLIC;
1489                          fixpos($$, $4);
1490                          local_pop();
1491                          in_def--;
1492                          cur_mid = $<id>3;
1493                      }

(parse.y)
</pre>


At @def@ , I could find the place where it is used. It can also be found in class
definitions and singleton class definitions, and module definitions.
In other words, it is the place where the scope of local variables is cut.
Moreover, as for how they are used,
it does @push@ where the method definition starts and does @pop@ when the definition ends.
This means, as we expected, it is almost certain that the functions start with
@local_@ are relating to local variables. And it is also revealed that the part
between @push@ and @pop@ is probably a local variable scope.


Moreover, I also searched @local_cnt()@ .


<p class="caption">▼ @NEW_LASGN()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 269  #define NEW_LASGN(v,val) rb_node_newnode(NODE_LASGN,v,val,local_cnt(v))

(node.h)
</pre>


This is found in @node.h@ . Even though there are also the places where using in @parse.y@ ,
I found it in the other file. Thus, probably I'm in desperation.


This @NEW_LASGN@ is "new local assignment". This should mean the node of an
assignment to a local variable. And also considering the place where using it,
the parameter @v@ is apparently the local variable name. @val@ is probably
(a syntax tree that represents). the right-hand side value


Based on the above observations, @local_push()@ is at the beginning of the local variable,
@local_cnt()@ is used to add a local variable if there's a local variable assignment in the halfway,
@local_pop()@ is used when ending the scope.
This perfect scenario comes out. (Fig.9)


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_localtbl.jpg" alt="(localtbl)"><br>
Fig.9: the flow of the local variable management
</p>


Then, let's look at the content of the function.


h3. @push@ and @pop@


<p class="caption">▼ @local_push()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5183  static void
5184  local_push(top)
5185      int top;
5186  {
5187      struct local_vars *local;
5188
5189      local = ALLOC(struct local_vars);
5190      local->prev = lvtbl;
5191      local->nofree = 0;
5192      local->cnt = 0;
5193      local->tbl = 0;
5194      local->dlev = 0;
5195      local->dyna_vars = ruby_dyna_vars;
5196      lvtbl = local;
5197      if (!top) {
5198          /* preserve the variable table of the previous scope into val  */
5199          rb_dvar_push(0, (VALUE)ruby_dyna_vars);
5200          ruby_dyna_vars->next = 0;
5201      }
5202  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


As we expected, it seems that @struct local_vars@ is used as a stack.
Also, we can see @lvtbl@ is pointing to the top of the stack.
The lines relates to @rb_dvar_push()@ will be read later, so it is left untouched for now.


Subsequently, we'll look at @local_pop()@ and @local_tbl()@ at the same time.


<p class="caption">▼ @local_tbl local_pop@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5218  static ID*
5219  local_tbl()
5220  {
5221      lvtbl->nofree = 1;
5222      return lvtbl->tbl;
5223  }

5204  static void
5205  local_pop()
5206  {
5207      struct local_vars *local = lvtbl->prev;
5208
5209      if (lvtbl->tbl) {
5210          if (!lvtbl->nofree) free(lvtbl->tbl);
5211          else lvtbl->tbl[0] = lvtbl->cnt;
5212      }
5213      ruby_dyna_vars = lvtbl->dyna_vars;
5214      free(lvtbl);
5215      lvtbl = local;
5216  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


I'd like you to look at @local_tbl()@ .
This is the function to obtain the current local variable table ( @lvtbl->tbl@ ).
By calling this, the @nofree@ of the current table becomes true.
The meaning of @nofree@ seems naturally "Don't @free()@ ".
In other words, this is like reference counting, "this table will be used, so
please don't @free()@ ". Conversely speaking,
when @local_tbl()@ was not called with a table even once,
that table will be freed at the moment when being popped and be discarded.
For example, this situation probably happens when a method without any local variables.


However, the "necessary table" here means @lvtbl->tbl@ .
As you can see, @lvtbl@ itself will be freed at the same moment when being popped.
It means only the generated @lvtbl->tbl@ is used in the evaluator.
Then, the structure of @lvtbl->tbl@ is becoming important.
Let's look at the function @local_cnt()@ (which seems) to add variables
which is probably helpful to understand how the structure is.


And before that, I'd like you to remember that @lvtbl->cnt@ is stored
at the index 0 of the @lvtbl->tbl@ .




h3. Adding variables


The function (which seems) to add a local variable is @local_cnt()@ .


<p class="caption">▼ @local_cnt()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5246  static int
5247  local_cnt(id)
5248      ID id;
5249  {
5250      int cnt, max;
5251
5252      if (id == 0) return lvtbl->cnt;
5253
5254      for (cnt=1, max=lvtbl->cnt+1; cnt<max;cnt++) {
5255          if (lvtbl->tbl[cnt] == id) return cnt-1;
5256      }
5257      return local_append(id);
5258  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


This scans @lvtbl->tbl@ and searches what is equals to @id@ .
If the searched one is found, it straightforwardly returns @cnt-1@ .
If nothing is found, it does @local_append()@ .
@local_append()@ must be, as it is called @append@ , the procedure to append.
In other words, @local_cnt()@ checks if the variable was already registered,
if it was not, adds it by using @local_append()@ and returns it.


What is the meaning of the return value of this function? @lvtbl->tbl@ seems an
array of the variables, so there're one-to-one correspondences between the
variable names and "their index - 1 ( @cnt-1@ )". (Fig.10)


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_lvtbltbl.jpg" alt="(lvtbltbl)"><br>
Fig.10: The correspondences between the variable names and the return values
</p>


Moreover, this return value is calculated so that the start point becomes 0,
the local variable space is probably an array.
And, this returns the index to access that array.
If it is not, like the instance variables or constants,
(the ID of) the variable name could have been used as a key in the first place.



You might want to know why it is avoiding index 0 (the loop start
from @cnt=1@ ) for some reasons, it is probably to store a value at @local_pop()@ .


Based on the knowledge we've learned, we can understand the role of @local_append()@
without actually looking at the content.
It registers a local variable and returns
"(the index of the variable in @lvtbl->tbl@ ) - 1".
It is shown below, let's make sure.


<p class="caption">▼ @local_append()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5225  static int
5226  local_append(id)
5227      ID id;
5228  {
5229      if (lvtbl->tbl == 0) {
5230          lvtbl->tbl = ALLOC_N(ID, 4);
5231          lvtbl->tbl[0] = 0;
5232          lvtbl->tbl[1] = '_';
5233          lvtbl->tbl[2] = '~';
5234          lvtbl->cnt = 2;
5235          if (id == '_') return 0;
5236          if (id == '~') return 1;
5237      }
5238      else {
5239          REALLOC_N(lvtbl->tbl, ID, lvtbl->cnt+2);
5240      }
5241
5242      lvtbl->tbl[lvtbl->cnt+1] = id;
5243      return lvtbl->cnt++;
5244  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


It seems definitely true. @lvtbl->tbl@ is an array of the local variable names,
and its index - 1 is the return value (local variable ID).


Note that it increases @lvtbl->cnt@ .
Since the code to increase @lvtbl->cnt@ only exists here,
from only this code its meaning can be decided.
Then, what is the meaning? It is,
since "@lvtbl->cnt@ increases by 1 when a new variable is added",
"@lvtbl->cnt@ holds the number of local variables in this scope".



Finally, I'll explain about @tbl[1]@ and @tbl[2]@ . These @'_'@ and @'~'@ are,
as you can guess if you are familiar with Ruby,
the special variables named @$_@ and @$~@ .
Though their appearances are identical to global variables,
they are actually local variables.
Even If you didn't explicitly use it, when the methods such as @Kernel#gets@ are called,
these variables are implicitly assigned,
thus it's necessary that the spaces are always allocated.




h3. Summary of local variables


Since the description of local variables were complex in various ways,
let's summarize it.


First, It seems the local variables are different from the other variables
because they are not managed with @st_table@ .
Then, where are they stored in? It seems the answer is an array.
Moreover, it is stored in a different array for each scope.


The array is @lvtbl->tbl@ , and the index 0 holds the @lvtbl->cnt@ which is set
at @local_pop()@ . In other words, it holds the number of the local variables.
The index 1 or more hold the local variable names defined in the scope.
Fig.11 shows the final appearance we expect.


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_tbl.jpg" alt="(tbl)"><br>
Fig.11: correspondences between local variable names and the return values
</p>





h3. Block Local Variables


The rest is @dyna_vars@ which is a member of @struct local_vars@.
In other words, this is about the block local variables.
I thought that there must be the functions to do something with this,
looked over the list of the function names,
and found them as expected.
There are the suspicious functions named @dyna_push() dyna_pop() dyna_in_block()@.
Moreover, here is the place where these are used.


<p class="caption">▼ an example using  @dyna_push dyna_pop@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
1651  brace_block     : '{'
1652                      {
1653                          $<vars>$ = dyna_push();
1654                      }
1655                    opt_block_var
1656                    compstmt '}'
1657                      {
1658                          $$ = NEW_ITER($3, 0, $4);
1659                          fixpos($$, $4);
1660                          dyna_pop($<vars>2);
1661                      }

(parse.y)
</pre>


@push@ at the beginning of an iterator block, @pop@ at the end.
This must be the process of block local variables.


Now, we are going to look at the functions.

<p class="caption">▼ @dyna_push()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5331  static struct RVarmap*
5332  dyna_push()
5333  {
5334      struct RVarmap* vars = ruby_dyna_vars;
5335
5336      rb_dvar_push(0, 0);
5337      lvtbl->dlev++;
5338      return vars;
5339  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


Increasing @lvtbl->dlev@ seems the mark indicates the existence of the block
local variable scope.
Meanwhile, @rb_dvar_push()@ is ...


<p class="caption">▼ @rb_dvar_push()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 691  void
 692  rb_dvar_push(id, value)
 693      ID id;
 694      VALUE value;
 695  {
 696      ruby_dyna_vars = new_dvar(id, value, ruby_dyna_vars);
 697  }

(eval.c)
</pre>


It creates a @struct RVarmap@ that has the variable name @id@ and the value
@val@ as its members, adds it to the top of the global variable @ruby_dyna_vars@ .
This is again and again the form of cons.
In @dyna_push()@ , @ruby_dyan_vars@ is not set aside,
it seems it adds directly to the @ruby_dyna_vars@ of the previous scope.


Moreover, the value of the @id@ member of the @RVarmap@ to be added here is 0.
Although it was not seriously discussed in this book,
the @ID@ of @ruby@ will never be 0 while it is normally created by @rb_intern()@ .
Thus, we can infer that this @RVarmap@ , as it is like @NUL@ or @NULL@ ,
probably has a role as sentinel.
If we think based on this assumption, we can describe the reason why the holder
of a variable ( @RVarmap@ ) is added even though not any variables are added.


Next, @dyna_pop()@ .


<p class="caption">▼ @dyna_pop()@ </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5341  static void
5342  dyna_pop(vars)
5343      struct RVarmap* vars;
5344  {
5345      lvtbl->dlev--;
5346      ruby_dyna_vars = vars;
5347  }

(parse.y)
</pre>


By reducing @lvtbl->dlev@ , it writes down the fact that the block local
variable scope ended.
It seems that something is done by using the argument,
let's see this later at once.


The place to add a block local variable has not appeared yet.
Something like @local_cnt()@ of local variables is missing.
So, I did plenty of @grep@ with @dvar@ and @dyna@ , and this code was found.


<p class="caption">▼ @assignable()@  (partial)</p>

<pre class="longlist">
4599  static NODE*
4600  assignable(id, val)
4601      ID id;
4602      NODE *val;
4603  {
                            ：
4634              rb_dvar_push(id, Qnil);
4635              return NEW_DASGN_CURR(id, val);

(parse.y)
</pre>


@assignable()@ is the function to create a node relates to assignments,
this citation is the fragment of that function only contains the part to deal
with block local variables.
It seems that it adds a new variable (to @ruby_dyna_vars@ )
by using @rb_dvar_push()@ that we've just seen.




h3. @ruby_dyna_vars@ in the parser


Now, taking the above all into considerations, let's imagine the appearance of
@ruby_dyna_vars@ at the moment when a local variable scope is finished to be
parsed.


First, as I said previously,
the @RVarmap@ of @id=0@ which is added at the beginning of a block scope is a
sentinel which represents a break between two block scopes.
We'll call this "the header of @ruby_dyna_vars@ ".


Next, among the previously shown actions of the rule of the iterator block,
I'd like you to focus on this part:



<pre class="emlist">
$<vars>$ = dyna_push();    /* what assigned into $<vars>$ is ... */
        ：
        ：
dyna_pop($<vars>2);        /* …… appears at $<vars>2 */
</pre>


@dyna_push()@ returns the @ruby_dyna_vars@ at the moment.
@dyna_pop()@ put the argument into @ruby_dyna_vars@ .
This means @ruby_dyna_vars@ would be saved and restored for each the block local
variable scope.
Therefore, when parsing the following program,



<pre class="emlist">
iter {
    a = nil
    iter {
        b = nil
        iter {
            c = nil
            # nesting level 3
        }
        bb = nil
        # nesting level 2
        iter {
            e = nil
        }
    }
    # nesting level 1
}
</pre>


Fig.12 shows the @ruby_dyna_vars@ in this situation.


<p class="image">
<img src="images/ch_syntree_dynavars.jpg" alt="(dynavars)"><br>
Fig.12: @ruby_dyna_vars@ when all scopes are finished to be parsed
</p>


This structure is fairly smart.
That's because the variables of the higher levels can naturally be accessed by
traversing over all of the list even if the nesting level is deep.
This way has the simpler searching process than creating a different table for
each level.


Plus, in the figure, it looks like @bb@ is hung at a strange place,
but this is correct.
When a variable is found at the nest level which is decreased after increased once,
it is attached to the subsequent of the list of the original level.
Moreover, in this way, the specification of local variable that
"only the variables which already exist in the symbol sequence are defined"
is expressed in a natural form.


And finally, at each cut of local variable scopes (this is not of block local
variable scopes), this link is entirely saved or restored to @lvtbl->dyna_vars@ .
I'd like you to go back a little and check @local_push()@ and @local_pop()@ .


By the way, although creating the @ruby_dyna_vars@ list was a huge task,
it is by itself not used at the evaluator. This list is used only to check the
existence of the variables and will be garbage collected at the same moment
when parsing is finished. And after entering the evaluator, another chain is
created again.
There's a quite deep reason for this, ... we'll see around this once again in
Part 3.
