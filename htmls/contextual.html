<h1>Chapter 11 Finite-state scanner</h1>
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>In theory, the scanner and the parser are completely independent of each other
– the scanner is supposed to recognize tokens, while the parser is supposed to
process the resulting series of tokens. It would be nice if things were that
simple, but in reality it rarely is. Depending on the context of the program it
is often necessary to alter the way tokens are recognized or their symbols. In
this chapter we will take a look at the way the scanner and the parser
cooperate.</p>
<h3>Practical examples</h3>
<p>In most programming languages, spaces don’t have any specific meaning unless
they are used to separate words. However, Ruby is not an ordinary language and
meanings can change significantly depending on the presence of spaces.
Here is an example</p>
<pre class="emlist">
a[i] = 1      # a[i] = (1)
a [i]         # a([i])
</pre>
<p>The former is an example of assigning an index. The latter is an example of
omitting the method call parentheses and passing a member of an array to a
parameter.</p>
<p>Here is another example.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
a  +  1    # (a) + (1)
a  +1      # a(+1)
</pre>
<p>This seems to be really disliked by some.</p>
<p>However, the above examples might give one the impression that only omitting
the method call parentheses can be a source of trouble. Let’s look at a
different example.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
`cvs diff parse.y`          # command call string
obj.`("cvs diff parse.y")   # normal method call
</pre>
<p>Here, the former is a method call using a literal. In contrast, the latter is a
normal method call (with &#8216;&#8217;&#8217; being the method name). Depending on the context,
they could be handled quite differently.</p>
<p>Below is another example where the functioning changes dramatically</p>
<pre class="emlist">
print(&lt;&lt;EOS)   # here-document
......
EOS

list = []
list &lt;&lt; nil    # list.push(nil)
</pre>
<p>The former is a method call using a here-document. The latter is a method call
using an operator.</p>
<p>As demonstrated, Ruby’s grammar contains many parts which are difficult to
implement in practice. I couldn’t realistically give a thorough description of
all in just one chapter, so in this one I will look at the basic principles and
those parts which present the most difficulty.</p>
<h3><code>lex_state</code></h3>
<p>There is a variable called “lex_state”. “lex”, obviously, stands for “lexer”.
Thus, it is a variable which shows the scanner’s state.</p>
<p>What states are there? Let’s look at the definitions.</p>
<p>▼ <code>enum lex_state</code></p>
<pre class="longlist">  61  static enum lex_state {
  62      EXPR_BEG,      /* ignore newline, +/- is a sign. */
  63      EXPR_END,      /* newline significant, +/- is a operator. */
  64      EXPR_ARG,      /* newline significant, +/- is a operator. */
  65      EXPR_CMDARG,   /* newline significant, +/- is a operator. */
  66      EXPR_ENDARG,   /* newline significant, +/- is a operator. */
  67      EXPR_MID,      /* newline significant, +/- is a operator. */
  68      EXPR_FNAME,    /* ignore newline, no reserved words. */
  69      EXPR_DOT,      /* right after `.' or `::', no reserved words. */
  70      EXPR_CLASS,    /* immediate after `class', no here document. */
  71  } lex_state;
(parse.y)</pre>
<p>The <span class="caps">EXPR</span> prefix stands for “expression”. <code>EXPR_BEG</code> is “Beginning of
expression” and <code>EXPR_DOT</code> is “inside the expression, after the dot”.</p>
<p>To elaborate, <code>EXPR_BEG</code> denotes “Located at the head of the expression”. 
<code>EXPR_END</code> denotes “Located at the end of the expression”. <code>EXPR_ARG</code> denotes
“Before the method parameter”. <code>EXPR_FNAME</code> denotes “Before the method name
(such as <code>def</code>)”. The ones not covered here will be analyzed in detail below.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I am led to believe that <code>lex_state</code> actually denotes “after
parentheses”, “head of statement”, so it shows the state of the parser rather
than the scanner. However, it’s still conventionally referred to as the
scanner’s state and here’s why.</p>
<p>The meaning of “state” here is actually subtly different from how it’s usually
understood. The “state” of <code>lex_state</code> is “a state under which the scanner does
x”. For example an accurate description of <code>EXPR_BEG</code> would be “A state under
which the scanner, if run, will react as if this is at the head of the
expression”</p>
<p>Technically, this “state” can be described as the state of the scanner if we
look at the scanner as a state machine. However, delving there would be veering
off topic and too tedious. I would refer any interested readers to any textbook
on data structures.</p>
<h3>Understanding the finite-state scanner</h3>
<p>The trick to reading a finite-state scanner is to not try to grasp everything
at once. Someone writing a parser would prefer not to use a finite-state
scanner. That is to say, they would prefer not to make it the main part of the
process. Scanner state management often ends up being an extra part attached to
the main part. In other words, there is no such thing as a clean and concise
diagram for state transitions.</p>
<p>What one should do is think toward specific goals: “This part is needed to
solve this task” “This code is for overcoming this problem”. Basically, put out
code in accordance with the task at hand. If you start thinking about the
mutual relationship between tasks, you’ll invariably end up stuck. Like I said,
there is simply no such thing.</p>
<p>However, there still needs to be an overreaching objective. When reading a
finite-state scanner, that objective would undoubtedly be to understand every
state. For example, what kind of state is <code>EXPR_BEG</code>? It is a state where the
parser is at the head of the expression.</p>
<h4>The static approach</h4>
<p>So, how can we understand what a state does? There are three basic approaches</p>
<ul>
	<li>Look at the name of the state</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest and most obvious approach. For example, the name <code>EXPR_BEG</code>
obviously refers to the head (beginning) of something.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Observe what changes under this state</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the way token recognition changes under the state, then test it in
comparison to previous examples.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Look at the state from which it transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at which state it transitions from and which token causes it. For example,
if <code>'\n'</code> is always followed by a transition to a <code>HEAD</code> state, it must denote
the head of the line.</p>
<p>Let us take <code>EXPR_BEG</code> as an example.
In Ruby, all state transitions are expressed as assignments to <code>lex_state</code>, so
first we need to grep <code>EXPR_BEG</code> assignments to find them. Then we need to
export their location, for example, such as <code>'#'</code> and <code>'*'</code> and <code>'!'</code> of
<code>yylex()</code> Then we need to recall the state prior to the transition and consider
which case suits best (see image 1)</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_contextual_transittobeg.jpg" alt="(transittobeg)"><br>
Figure 1: Transition to <code>EXPR_BEG</code></p>
</p>
<p>This does indeed look like the head of statement. Especially the <code>'\n'</code> and the
<code>';'</code> The open parentheses and the comma also suggest that it’s the head not
just of the statement, but of the expression as well.</p>
<h4>The dynamic approach</h4>
<p>There are other easy methods to observe the functioning. For example, you can
use a debugger to “hook” the <code>yylex()</code> and look at the <code>lex_state</code></p>
<p>Another way is to rewrite the source code to output state transitions. In the
case of <code>lex_state</code> we only have numerical patterns for assignment and
comparison, so the solution would be to treat them as text patterns and rewrite
the code to output state transitions. The CD that comes with this book contains
the <code>rubylex-analyser</code> tool. When necessary, I will refer to it in this text.</p>
<p>The overall process looks like this: use a debugger or the aforementioned tool
to observe the functioning of the program. Then look at the source code to
confirm the acquired data and use it.</p>
<h3>Description of states</h3>
<p>Here I will give simple descriptions of <code>lex_state</code> states.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_BEG</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Head of expression. Comes immediately after <code>\n ( { [ ! ? : ,</code> or the operator
<code>op=</code> The most general state.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_MID</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comes immediately after the reserved words <code>return break next rescue</code>.
Invalidates binary operators such as <code>*</code> or <code>&amp;</code>
Generally similar in function to <code>EXPR_BEG</code></p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_ARG</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comes immediately after elements which are likely to be the method name in a
method call.
Also comes immediately after <code>'['</code>
Except for cases where <code>EXPR_CMDARG</code> is used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_CMDARG</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comes before the first parameter of a normal method call.
For more information, see the section “The <code>do</code> conflict”</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_END</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Used when there is a possibility that the statement is terminal. For example,
after a literal or brackets. Except for cases when <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> is used</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_ENDARG</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Special iteration of <code>EXPR_END</code> Comes immediately after the closing parenthesis
corresponding to <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>
Refer to the section “First parameter enclosed in parentheses”</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_FNAME</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comes before the method name, usually after <code>def</code>, <code>alias</code>, <code>undef</code> or the
symbol <code>':'</code> In an independent position <code>`</code> is the method name.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_DOT</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comes after the dot in a method call. Handled similarly to <code>EXPR_FNAME</code>
Various reserved words are treated as simple identifiers.
In an independent position <code>'`'</code> is the name.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>EXPR_CLASS</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Comes after the reserved word <code>class</code> This is a very limited state.</p>
<p>The following states can be grouped together</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>BEG MID</code></li>
	<li><code>END ENDARG</code></li>
	<li><code>ARG CMDARG</code></li>
	<li><code>FNAME DOT</code></li>
</ul>
<p>They all express similar conditions. <code>EXPR_CLASS</code> is a little different, but
only appears in a limited number of places, not warranting any special
attention.</p>
<h2>Line-break handling</h2>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>In Ruby, a statement does not necessarily require a terminator. In C or Java a
statement must always end with a semicolon, but Ruby has no such requirement.
Statements usually take up only one line, and thus end at the end of the line.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a statement is clearly continued, this happens
automatically. Some conditions for “This statement is clearly continued” are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>After a comma</li>
	<li>After an infix operator</li>
	<li>Parentheses or brackets are not balanced</li>
	<li>Immediately after the reserved word <code>if</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Etc.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>So, what do we need to implement this grammar? Simply having the scanner ignore
line-breaks is not sufficient. In a grammar like Ruby’s, where statements are
delimited by reserved words on both ends, conflicts don’t happen as frequently
as in C languages, but when I tried a simple experiment, I couldn’t get it to
work until I got rid of <code>return</code>
<code>next</code> <code>break</code> and returned the method call parentheses wherever they were
omitted. To retain those features we need some kind of terminal symbol for
statements’ ends. It doesn’t matter whether it’s <code>\n</code> or <code>';'</code> but it is
necessary.</p>
<p>Two solutions exist – parser-based and scanner-based. For the former, you can
just optionally put <code>\n</code> in every place that allows it. For the latter, have
the <code>\n</code> passed to the parser only when it has some meaning (ignoring it
otherwise).</p>
<p>Which solution to use is up to your preferences, but usually the scanner-based
one is used. That way produces a more compact code. Moreover, if the rules are
overloaded with meaningless symbols, it defeats the purpose of the
parser-generator.</p>
<p>To sum up, in Ruby, line-breaks are best handled using the scanner. When a line
needs to continued, the <code>\n</code> will be ignored, and when it needs to be
terminated, the <code>\n</code> is passed as a token. In the <code>yylex()</code> this is found here:</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex()</code>-<code>'\n'</code>
<pre class="longlist">
3155        case &#8216;\n&#8217;:
3156          switch (lex_state) {
3157            case EXPR_BEG:
3158            case EXPR_FNAME:
3159            case EXPR_DOT:
3160            case EXPR_CLASS:
3161              goto retry;
3162            default:
3163              break;
3164          }
3165          command_start = Qtrue;
3166          lex_state = EXPR_BEG;
3167          return &#8216;\n&#8217;;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>With <code>EXPR_BEG</code>, <code>EXPR_FNAME</code>, <code>EXPR_DOT</code>, <code>EXPR_CLASS</code> it will be <code>goto retry</code>.
That is to say, it’s meaningless and shall be ignored. The label <code>retry</code> is
found in front of the large <code>switch</code> in the <code>yylex()</code></p>
<p>In all other instances, line-breaks are meaningful and shall be passed to the
parser, after which <code>lex_state</code> is restored to <code>EXPR_BEG</code> Basically, whenever a
line-break is meaningful, it will be the end of <code>expr</code></p>
<p>I recommend leaving <code>command_start</code> alone for the time being. To reiterate,
trying to grasp too many things at once will only end in needless confusion.</p>
<p>Let us now take a look at some examples using the <code>rubylex-analyser</code> tool.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% rubylex-analyser -e '
m(a,
  b, c) unless i
'
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C      "\nm"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_CMDARG
EXPR_CMDARG           "("  '('                  EXPR_BEG
                                              0:cond push
                                              0:cmd push
EXPR_BEG     C        "a"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_CMDARG
EXPR_CMDARG           ","  ','                  EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG    S     "\n  b"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_ARG
EXPR_ARG              ","  ','                  EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG    S         "c"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_ARG
EXPR_ARG              ")"  ')'                  EXPR_END
                                              0:cond lexpop
                                              0:cmd lexpop
EXPR_END    S    "unless"  kUNLESS_MOD          EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG    S         "i"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_ARG
EXPR_ARG             "\n"  \n                   EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C       "\n"  '                    EXPR_BEG
</pre>
<p>As you can see, there is a lot of output here, but we only need the left and
middle columns. The left column displays the <code>lex_state</code> before it enters the
<code>yylex()</code> while the middle column displays the tokens and their symbols.</p>
<p>The first token <code>m</code> and the second parameter <code>b</code> are preceded by a line-break
but a <code>\n</code> is appended in front of them and it is not treated as a terminal
symbol. That is because the <code>lex_state</code> is <code>EXPR_BEG</code>.</p>
<p>However, in the second to last line <code>\n</code> is used as a terminal symbol.
That is because the state is <code>EXPR_ARG</code></p>
<p>And that is how it should be used. Let us have another example.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% rubylex-analyser -e 'class
C &lt; Object
end'
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C    "class"  kCLASS               EXPR_CLASS
EXPR_CLASS          "\nC"  tCONSTANT            EXPR_END
EXPR_END    S         "&lt;"  '&lt;'                  EXPR_BEG
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG    S    "Object"  tCONSTANT            EXPR_ARG
EXPR_ARG             "\n"  \n                   EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C      "end"  kEND                 EXPR_END
EXPR_END             "\n"  \n                   EXPR_BEG
</pre>
<p>The reserved word <code>class</code> is followed by <code>EXPR_CLASS</code> so the line-break is ignored.
However, the superclass <code>Object</code> is followed by <code>EXPR_ARG</code>, so the <code>\n</code> appears.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% rubylex-analyser -e 'obj.
class'
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C      "obj"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_CMDARG
EXPR_CMDARG           "."  '.'                  EXPR_DOT
EXPR_DOT        "\nclass"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_ARG
EXPR_ARG             "\n"  \n                   EXPR_BEG
</pre>
<p><code>'.'</code> is followed by <code>EXPR_DOT</code> so the <code>\n</code> is ignored.</p>
<p>Note that <code>class</code> becomes <code>tIDENTIFIER</code> despite being a reserved word.
This is discussed in the next section.</p>
<h2>Reserved words and identical method names</h2>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>In Ruby, reserved words can used as method names. However, in actuality it’s
not as simple as “it can be used” – there exist three possible contexts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Method definition (<code>def xxxx</code>)</li>
	<li>Call (<code>obj.xxxx</code>)</li>
	<li>Symbol literal (<code>:xxxx</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three are possible in Ruby. Below we will take a closer look at each.</p>
<p>First, the method definition.
It is preceded by the reserved word <code>def</code> so it should work.</p>
<p>In case of the method call, omitting the receiver can be a source of difficulty.
However, the scope of use here is even more limited, and omitting the receiver
is actually forbidden. That is, when the method name is a reserved word, the
receiver absolutely cannot be omitted. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say
that it is forbidden in order to guarantee that parsing is always possible.</p>
<p>Finally, in case of the symbol, it is preceded by the terminal symbol <code>':'</code> so
it also should work. However, regardless of reserved words, the <code>':'</code> here
conflicts with the colon in <code>a?b:c</code> If this is avoided, there should be no
further trouble.</p>
<p>For each of these cases, similarly to before, a scanner-based solution and a
parser-based solution exist. For the former use <code>tIDENTIFIER</code> (for example) as
the reserved word that comes after  <code>def</code> or <code>.</code> or <code>:</code> For the latter, make
that into a rule. Ruby allows for both solutions to be used in each of the
three cases.</p>
<h3>Method definition</h3>
<p>The name part of the method definition. This is handled by the parser.</p>
<p>▼ Method definition rule
<pre class="longlist">
                | kDEF fname
                  f_arglist
                  bodystmt
                  kEND
                | kDEF singleton dot_or_colon  fname
                  f_arglist
                  bodystmt
                  kEND
</pre></p>
<p>There exist only two rules for method definition – one for normal methods and
one for singleton methods. For both, the name part is <code>fname</code> and it is defined
as follows.</p>
<p>▼ <code>fname</code>
<pre class="longlist">
fname           : tIDENTIFIER
                | tCONSTANT
                | tFID
                | op
                | reswords
</pre></p>
<p><code>reswords</code> is a reserved word and <code>op</code> is a binary operator. Both rules consist
of simply all terminal symbols lined up, so I won’t go into detail here.
Finally, for <code>tFID</code> the end contains symbols similarly to <code>gsub!</code> and <code>include?</code></p>
<h3>Method call</h3>
<p>Method calls with names identical to reserved words are handled by the scanner.
The scan code for reserved words is shown below.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
Scanning the identifier
result = (tIDENTIFIER or tCONSTANT)

if (lex_state != EXPR_DOT) {
    struct kwtable *kw;

    /* See if it is a reserved word.  */
    kw = rb_reserved_word(tok(), toklen());
    Reserved word is processed
}
</pre>
<p><code>EXPR_DOT</code> expresses what comes after the method call dot. Under <code>EXPR_DOT</code>
reserved words are universally not processed. The symbol for reserved words
after the dot becomes either <code>tIDENTIFIER</code> or <code>tCONSTANT</code>.</p>
<h3>Symbols</h3>
<p>Reserved word symbols are handled by both the scanner and the parser.
First, the rule.</p>
<p>▼ <code>symbol</code>
<pre class="longlist">
symbol          : tSYMBEG sym</p>
<p>sym             : fname
                | tIVAR
                | tGVAR
                | tCVAR</p>
<p>fname           : tIDENTIFIER
                | tCONSTANT
                | tFID
                | op
                | reswords
</pre></p>
<p>Reserved words (<code>reswords</code>) are explicitly passed through the parser. This is
only possible because the special terminal symbol <code>tSYMBEG</code> is present at the
start. If the symbol were, for example, <code>':'</code> it would conflict with the
conditional operator (<code>a?b:c</code>) and stall. Thus, the trick is to recognize
<code>tSYMBEG</code> on the scanner level.</p>
<p>But how to cause that recognition? Let’s look at the implementation of the
scanner.</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-<code>':'</code>
<pre class="longlist">
3761        case &#8216;:&#8217;:
3762          c = nextc();
3763          if (c == &#8216;:&#8217;) {
3764              if (lex_state == EXPR_BEG ||  lex_state == EXPR_MID ||
3765                  (IS_ARG() &amp;&amp; space_seen)) {
3766                  lex_state = EXPR_BEG;
3767                  return tCOLON3;
3768              }
3769              lex_state = EXPR_DOT;
3770              return tCOLON2;
3771          }
3772          pushback&#169;;
3773          if (lex_state == EXPR_END ||
                  lex_state == EXPR_ENDARG ||
                  ISSPACE&#169;) {
3774              lex_state = EXPR_BEG;
3775              return &#8216;:&#8217;;
3776          }
3777          lex_state = EXPR_FNAME;
3778          return tSYMBEG;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>This is a situation when the <code>if</code> in the first half has two consecutive <code>':'</code>
In this situation, the <code>'::'</code>is scanned in accordance with the leftmost longest
match basic rule.</p>
<p>For the next <code>if</code> , the <code>':'</code> is the aforementioned conditional operator. Both
<code>EXPR_END</code> and <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> come at the end of the expression, so a parameter
does not appear. That is to say, since there can’t be a symbol, the <code>':'</code> is a
conditional operator.
Similarly, if the next letter is a space (<code>ISSPACE(c)</code>) , a symbol is unlikely
so it is again a conditional operator.</p>
<p>When none of the above applies, it’s all symbols. In that case, a transition to
<code>EXPR_FNAME</code> occurs to prepare for all method names. There is no particular
danger to parsing here, but if this is forgotten, the scanner will not pass
values to reserved words and value calculation will be disrupted.</p>
<h2>Modifiers</h2>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>For example, for <code>if</code> if there exists  a normal notation and one for postfix
modification.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
# Normal notation
if cond then
  expr
end

# Postfix
expr if cond
</pre>
<p>This could cause  a conflict. The reason can be guessed – again, it’s because
method parentheses have been omitted previously. Observe this example</p>
<pre class="emlist">
call if cond then a else b end
</pre>
<p>Reading this expression up to the <code>if</code> gives us two possible interpretations.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
call((if ....))
call() if ....
</pre>
<p>When unsure, I recommend simply using trial and error and seeing if a conflict
occurs. Let us try to handle it with <code>yacc</code> after changing <code>kIF_MOD</code> to <code>kIF</code>
in the grammar.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% yacc parse.y
parse.y contains 4 shift/reduce conflicts and 13 reduce/reduce conflicts.
</pre>
<p>As expected, conflicts are aplenty. If you are interested, you add the option
<code>-v</code> to <code>yacc</code> and build a log. The nature of the conflicts should be shown
there in great detail.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>So, what is there to do? In Ruby, on the symbol level (that is, on the scanner
level) the normal <code>if</code> is distinguished from the postfix <code>if</code> by them being
<code>kIF</code> and <code>kIF_MOD</code> respectively. This also applies to all other postfix
operators. In all, there are five &#8211; <code>kUNLESS_MOD kUNTIL_MOD kWHILE_MOD</code>
<code>kRESCUE_MOD</code> and <code>kIF_MOD</code> The distinction is made here:</p>

<p>This is located at the end of <code>yylex</code> after the identifiers are scanned.
The part that handles modifiers is the last (innermost) <code>if</code>〜<code>else</code> Whether
the return value is altered can be determined by whether or not the state is
<code>EXPR_BEG</code>. This is where a modifier is identified. Basically, the variable <code>kw</code>
is the key and if you look far above you will find that it is <code>struct kwtable</code></p>
<p>I’ve already described in the previous chapter how <code>struct kwtable</code> is a
structure defined in <code>keywords</code> and the hash function <code>rb_reserved_word()</code> is
created by <code>gperf</code>. I’ll show the structure here again.</p>

(keywords)</pre>
<p>I’ve already explained about <code>name</code> and <code>id[0]</code> &#8211; they are the reserved word
name and its symbol. Here I will speak about the remaining members.</p>
<p>First, <code>id[1]</code> is a symbol to deal with modifiers. For example, in case of <code>if</code>
that would be <code>kIF_MOD</code>.
When a reserved word does not have a modifier equivalent, <code>id[0]</code> and <code>id[1]</code>
contain the same things.</p>
<p>Because <code>state</code> is <code>enum lex_state</code> it is the state to which a transition
should occur after the reserved word is read.
Below is a list created in the <code>kwstat.rb</code> tool which I made. The tool can be
found on the CD.</p>

<h2>The <code>do</code> conflict</h2>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>There are two iterator forms &#8211; <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> and <code>{</code>〜<code>}</code> Their difference is in
priority &#8211; <code>{</code>〜<code>}</code> has a much higher priority. A higher priority means that as
part of the grammar a unit is “small” which means it can be put into a smaller
rule. For example, it can be put not into <code>stmt</code> but <code>expr</code> or <code>primary</code>. In
the past <code>{</code>〜<code>}</code> iterators were in <code>primary</code> while <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> iterators were
in <code>stmt</code></p>
<p>By the way, there has been a request for an expression like this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m do .... end + m do .... end
</pre>
<p>To allow for this, put the <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> iterator in <code>arg</code> or <code>primary</code>.
Incidentally, the condition for <code>while</code> is <code>expr</code>, meaning it contains <code>arg</code>
and <code>primary</code>, so the <code>do</code> will cause a conflict here. Basically, it looks like
this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
while m do
  ....
end
</pre>
<p>At first glance, the <code>do</code> looks like the <code>do</code> of <code>while</code>. However, a closer
look reveals that it could be a <code>m do</code>〜<code>end</code> bundling. Something that’s not
obvious even to a person will definitely cause <code>yacc</code> to conflict. Let’s try it
in practice.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
/* do conflict experiment */
%token kWHILE kDO tIDENTIFIER kEND
%%
expr: kWHILE expr kDO expr kEND
    | tIDENTIFIER
    | tIDENTIFIER kDO expr kEND
</pre>
<p>I simplified the example to only include <code>while</code>, variable referencing and
iterators. This rule causes a shift/reduce conflict if the head of the
conditional contains <code>tIDENTIFIER</code>. If <code>tIDENTIFIER</code> is used for variable
referencing and <code>do</code> is appended to <code>while</code>, then it’s reduction. If it’s made
an iterator <code>do</code>, then it’s a shift.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a shift/reduce conflict the shift is prioritized, so if left
unchecked, <code>do</code> will become an iterator <code>do</code>.  That said, even if a reduction
is forced through operator priorities or some other method, <code>do</code> won’t shift at
all, becoming unusable. Thus, to solve the problem without any contradictions,
we need to either deal with on the scanner level or write a rule that allows to
use operators without putting the <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> iterator into <code>expr</code>.</p>
<p>However, not putting <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> into <code>expr</code> is not a realistic goal. That
would require all rules for <code>expr</code> (as well as for <code>arg</code> and <code>primary</code>) to be
repeated. This leaves us only the scanner solution.</p>
<h3>Rule-level solution</h3>
<p>Below is a simplified example of a relevant rule.</p>
<p>▼ <code>do</code> symbol
<pre class="longlist">
primary         : kWHILE expr_value do compstmt kEND</p>
<p>do              : term
                | kDO_COND</p>
<p>primary         : operation brace_block
                | method_call brace_block</p>
<p>brace_block     : &#8216;{&#8217; opt_block_var compstmt &#8216;}&#8217;
                | kDO opt_block_var compstmt kEND
</pre></p>
<p>As you can see, the terminal symbols for the <code>do</code> of <code>while</code> and for the
iterator <code>do</code> are different. For the former it’s <code>kDO_COND</code> while for the
latter it’s <code>kDO</code> Then it’s simply a matter of pointing that distinction out to
the scanner.</p>
<h3>Symbol-level solution</h3>
<p>Below is a partial view of the <code>yylex</code> section that processes reserved words.
It’s the only part tasked with processing <code>do</code> so looking at this code should
be enough to understand the criteria for making the distinction.</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-Identifier-Reserved word</p>
<pre class="longlist">4183                      if (kw-&gt;id[0] == kDO) {
4184                          if (COND_P()) return kDO_COND;
4185                          if (CMDARG_P() &amp;&amp; state != EXPR_CMDARG)
4186                              return kDO_BLOCK;
4187                          if (state == EXPR_ENDARG)
4188                              return kDO_BLOCK;
4189                          return kDO;
4190                      }
(parse.y)</pre>
<p>It’s a little messy, but you only need the part associated with <code>kDO_COND</code>.
That is because only two comparisons are meaningful.
The first is the comparison between <code>kDO_COND</code> and <code>kDO</code>/<code>kDO_BLOCK</code> 
The second is the comparison between <code>kDO</code> and <code>kDO_BLOCK</code>.
The rest are meaningless.
Right now we only need to distinguish the conditional <code>do</code> &#8211; leave all the
other conditions alone.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>COND_P()</code> is the key.</p>
<h3><code>COND_P()</code></h3>
<h4><code>cond_stack</code></h4>
<p><code>COND_P()</code> is defined close to the head of <code>parse.y</code></p>
<p>▼ <code>cond_stack</code>
<pre class="longlist">
  75  #ifdef HAVE_LONG_LONG
  76  typedef unsigned LONG_LONG stack_type;
  77  #else
  78  typedef unsigned long stack_type;
  79  #endif
  80
  81  static stack_type cond_stack = 0;
  82  #define COND_PUSH(n) (cond_stack = (cond_stack&lt;&lt;1)|((n)&amp;1))
  83  #define COND_POP() (cond_stack &gt;&gt;= 1)
  84  #define COND_LEXPOP() do {\
  85      int last = COND_P();\
  86      cond_stack &gt;&gt;= 1;\
  87      if (last) cond_stack |= 1;\
  88  } while (0)
  89  #define COND_P() (cond_stack&amp;1)</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>The type <code>stack_type</code> is either <code>long</code> (over 32 bit) or <code>long long</code> (over 64
bit). <code>cond_stack</code> is initialized by <code>yycompile()</code> at the start of parsing and
after that is handled only through macros. All you need, then, is to understand
those macros.</p>
<p>If you look at <code>COND_PUSH</code>/<code>POP</code> you will see that these macros use integers as
stacks consisting of bits.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
MSB←   →LSB
...0000000000         Initial value 0
...0000000001         COND_PUSH(1)
...0000000010         COND_PUSH(0)
...0000000101         COND_PUSH(1)
...0000000010         COND_POP()
...0000000100         COND_PUSH(0)
...0000000010         COND_POP()
</pre>
<p>As for <code>COND_P()</code>, since it determines whether or not the least significant bit
(<span class="caps">LSB</span>) is a 1, it effectively determines whether the head of the stack is a 1.</p>
<p>The remaining <code>COND_LEXPOP()</code> is a little weird. It leaves <code>COND_P()</code> at the
head of the stack and executes a right shift. Basically, it “crushes” the
second bit from the bottom with the lowermost bit.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
MSB←   →LSB
...0000000000         Initial value 0
...0000000001         COND_PUSH(1)
...0000000010         COND_PUSH(0)
...0000000101         COND_PUSH(1)
...0000000011         COND_LEXPOP()
...0000000100         COND_PUSH(0)
...0000000010         COND_LEXPOP()
</pre>
<p>Now I will explain what that means.</p>
<h4>Investigating the function</h4>
<p>Let us investigate the function of this stack. To do that I will list up all
the parts where <code>COND_PUSH() COND_POP()</code> are used.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
        | kWHILE {COND_PUSH(1);} expr_value do {COND_POP();}
--
        | kUNTIL {COND_PUSH(1);} expr_value do {COND_POP();}
--
        | kFOR block_var kIN {COND_PUSH(1);} expr_value do {COND_POP();}
--
      case '(':
                :
                :
        COND_PUSH(0);
        CMDARG_PUSH(0);
--
      case '[':
                :
                :
        COND_PUSH(0);
        CMDARG_PUSH(0);
--
      case '{':
                :
                :
        COND_PUSH(0);
        CMDARG_PUSH(0);
--
      case ']':
      case '}':
      case ')':
        COND_LEXPOP();
        CMDARG_LEXPOP();
</pre>
<p>From this we can derive the following general rules</p>
<ul>
	<li>At the start of a conditional expression <code>PUSH(1)</code></li>
	<li>At opening parenthesis <code>PUSH(0)</code></li>
	<li>At the end of a conditional expression <code>POP()</code></li>
	<li>At closing parenthesis<code>LEXPOP()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this, you should see how to use it. If you think about it for a minute,
the name <code>cond_stack</code> itself is clearly the name for a macro that determines
whether or not it’s on the same level as the conditional expression (see image 2)</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_contextual_condp.jpg" alt="(condp)"><br>
Figure 2: Changes of <code>COND_P()</code></p>
</p>
<p>Using this trick should also make situations like the one shown below easy to
deal with.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
while (m do .... end)   # do is an iterator do(kDO)
  ....
end
</pre>
<p>This means that on a 32-bit machine in the absence of <code>long long</code> if
conditional expressions or parentheses are nested at 32 levels, things could
get strange. Of course, in reality you won’t need to nest so deep so there’s no
actual risk.</p>
<p>Finally, the definition of <code>COND_LEXPOP()</code> looks a bit strange – that seems to
be a way of dealing with lookahead. However, the rules now do not allow for
lookahead to occur, so there’s no purpose to make the distinction between <code>POP</code>
and <code>LEXPOP</code>. Basically, at this time it would be correct to say that
<code>COND_LEXPOP()</code> has no meaning.</p>
<h2><code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>(1)</h2>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>This one is very complicated. It only became workable in in Ruby 1.7 and only
fairly recently. The core of the issue is interpreting this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
call (expr) + 1
</pre>
<p>As one of the following</p>
<pre class="emlist">
(call(expr)) + 1
call((expr) + 1)
</pre>
<p>In the past, it was always interpreted as the former. That is, the parentheses
were always treated as “Method parameter parentheses”. But since Ruby 1.7 it
became possible to interpret it as the latter – basically, if a space is added,
the parentheses become “Parentheses of <code>expr</code>”</p>
<p>I will also provide an example to explain why the interpretation changed.
First, I wrote a statement as follows</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p m() + 1
</pre>
<p>So far so good. But let’s assume the value returned by <code>m</code> is a fraction and
there are too many digits. Then we will have it displayed as an integer.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p m() + 1 .to_i   # ??
</pre>
<p>Uh-oh, we need parentheses.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p (m() + 1).to_i
</pre>
<p>How to interpret this? Up to 1.6 it will be this</p>
<pre class="emlist">
(p(m() + 1)).to_i
</pre>
<p>The much-needed <code>to_i</code> is rendered meaningless, which is unacceptable.
To counter that, adding a space between it and the parentheses will cause the
parentheses to be treated specially as <code>expr</code> parentheses.</p>
<p>For those eager to test this, this feature was implemented in <code>parse.y</code>
revision 1.100(2001-05-31). Thus, it should be relatively prominent when
looking at the differences between it and 1.99. This is the command to find the
difference.</p>
<pre class="screen">
~/src/ruby % cvs diff -r1.99 -r1.100 parse.y
</pre>
<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>First let us look at how the set-up works in reality. Using the <code>ruby-lexer</code>
tool{<code>ruby-lexer</code>: located in <code>tools/ruby-lexer.tar.gz</code> on the CD} we can look
at the list of symbols corresponding to the program.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby-lexer -e 'm(a)'
tIDENTIFIER '(' tIDENTIFIER ')' '\n'
</pre>
<p>Similarly to Ruby, <code>-e</code> is the option to pass the program directly from the
command line. With this we can try all kinds of things. Let’s start with the
problem at hand – the case where the first parameter is enclosed in parentheses.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby-lexer -e 'm (a)'
tIDENTIFIER tLPAREN_ARG tIDENTIFIER ')' '\n'
</pre>
<p>After adding a space, the symbol of the opening parenthesis became <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>.
Now let’s look at normal expression parentheses.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% ruby-lexer -e '(a)'
tLPAREN tIDENTIFIER ')' '\n'
</pre>
<p>For normal expression parentheses it seems to be <code>tLPAREN</code>. To sum up:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Input    </th>
		<th>Symbol of opening parenthesis </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <code>m(a)</code>   </td>
		<td> <code>'('</code> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <code>m  (a)</code> </td>
		<td> <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <code>(a)</code>    </td>
		<td> <code>tLPAREN</code> </td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Thus the focus is distinguishing between the three. For now <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> is
the most important.</p>
<h3>The case of one parameter</h3>
<p>We’ll start by looking at the <code>yylex()</code> section for <code>'('</code></p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-<code>'('</code>
<pre class="longlist">
3841        case &#8216;(&#8217;:
3842          command_start = Qtrue;
3843          if (lex_state == EXPR_BEG || lex_state == EXPR_MID) {
3844              c = tLPAREN;
3845          }
3846          else if (space_seen) {
3847              if (lex_state == EXPR_CMDARG) {
3848                  c = tLPAREN_ARG;
3849              }
3850              else if (lex_state == EXPR_ARG) {
3851                  c = tLPAREN_ARG;
3852                  yylval.id = last_id;
3853              }
3854          }
3855          COND_PUSH(0);
3856          CMDARG_PUSH(0);
3857          lex_state = EXPR_BEG;
3858          return c;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>Since the first <code>if</code> is <code>tLPAREN</code> we’re looking at a normal expression
parenthesis. The distinguishing feature is that <code>lex_state</code> is either <code>BEG</code> or
<code>MID</code> &#8211; that is, it’s clearly at the beginning of the expression.</p>
<p>The following <code>space_seen</code> shows whether the parenthesis is preceded by a space.
If there is a space and <code>lex_state</code> is either <code>ARG</code> or <code>CMDARG</code>, basically if
it’s before the first parameter, the symbol is not <code>'('</code> but <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>.
This way, for example, the following situation can be avoided</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m(              # Parenthesis not preceded by a space. Method parenthesis ('(')
m arg, (        # Unless first parameter, expression parenthesis (tLPAREN)
</pre>
<p>When it is neither <code>tLPAREN</code> nor <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>, the input character <code>c</code> is used
as is and becomes <code>'('</code>. This will definitely be a method call parenthesis.</p>
<p>If such a clear distinction is made on the symbol level, no conflict should
occur even if rules are written as usual. Simplified, it becomes something like
this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
stmt         : command_call

method_call  : tIDENTIFIER '(' args ')'    /* Normal method */

command_call : tIDENTIFIER command_args    /* Method with parentheses omitted */

command_args : args

args         : arg
             : args ',' arg

arg          : primary

primary      : tLPAREN compstmt ')'        /* Normal expression parenthesis */
             | tLPAREN_ARG expr ')'        /* First parameter enclosed in parentheses */
             | method_call
</pre>
<p>Now I need you to focus on <code>method_call</code> and <code>command_call</code> If you leave the
<code>'('</code> without introducing <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>, then <code>command_args</code> will produce
<code>args</code>, <code>args</code> will produce <code>arg</code>, <code>arg</code> will produce <code>primary</code>. Then, <code>'('</code>
will appear from <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> and conflict with <code>method_call</code> (see image 3)</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_contextual_trees.jpg" alt="(trees)"><br>
Figure 3: <code>method_call</code> and <code>command_call</code></p>
</p>
<h3>The case of two parameters and more</h3>
<p>One might think that if the parenthesis becomes <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> all will be well.
That is not so. For example, consider the following</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a, a, a)
</pre>
<p>Before now, expressions like this one were treated as method calls and did not
produce errors. However, if <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> is introduced, the opening
parenthesis becomes an <code>expr</code> parenthesis, and if two or more parameters are
present, that will cause a parse error. This needs to be resolved for the sake
of compatibility.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, rushing ahead and just adding a rule like</p>
<pre class="emlist">
command_args : tLPAREN_ARG args ')'
</pre>
<p>will just cause a conflict. Let’s look at the bigger picture and think carefully.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
stmt         : command_call
             | expr

expr         : arg

command_call : tIDENTIFIER command_args

command_args : args
             | tLPAREN_ARG args ')'

args         : arg
             : args ',' arg

arg          : primary

primary      : tLPAREN compstmt ')'
             | tLPAREN_ARG expr ')'
             | method_call

method_call  : tIDENTIFIER '(' args ')'
</pre>
<p>Look at the first rule of <code>command_args</code> Here, <code>args</code> produces <code>arg</code> Then <code>arg</code>
produces <code>primary</code> and out of there comes the <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> rule. And since
<code>expr</code> contains <code>arg</code> and as it is expanded, it becomes like this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
command_args : tLPAREN_ARG arg ')'
             | tLPAREN_ARG arg ')'
</pre>
<p>This is a reduce/reduce conflict, which is very bad.</p>
<p>So, how can we deal with only 2+ parameters without causing a conflict? We’ll
have to write to accommodate for that situation specifically. In practice, it’s
solved like this:</p>
<p>▼ <code>command_args</code>
<pre class="longlist">
command_args    : open_args</p>
<p>open_args       : call_args
                | tLPAREN_ARG   &#8216;)&#8217;
                | tLPAREN_ARG call_args2  &#8216;)&#8217;</p>
<p>call_args       : command
                | args opt_block_arg
                | args &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | assocs opt_block_arg
                | assocs &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | args &#8216;,&#8217; assocs opt_block_arg
                | args &#8216;,&#8217; assocs &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg opt_block_arg
                | tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | block_arg</p>
<p>call_args2      : arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | assocs opt_block_arg
                | assocs &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; assocs opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args &#8216;,&#8217; assocs opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; assocs &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args &#8216;,&#8217; assocs &#8216;,&#8217;
                                  tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | block_arg</p>
<p>primary         : literal
                | strings
                | xstring
                       :
                | tLPAREN_ARG expr  &#8216;)&#8217;
</pre></p>
<p>Here <code>command_args</code> is followed by another level &#8211; <code>open_args</code> which may not be
reflected in the rules without consequence. The key is the second and third
rules of this <code>open_args</code> This form is similar to the recent example, but is
actually subtly different. The difference is that <code>call_args2</code> has been
introduced. The defining characteristic of this <code>call_args2</code> is that the number
of parameters is always two or more. This is evidenced by the fact that most
rules contain <code>','</code> The only exception is <code>assocs</code>, but since <code>assocs</code> does not
come out of <code>expr</code> it cannot conflict anyway.</p>
<p>That wasn’t a very good explanation. To put it simply, in a grammar where this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
command_args    : call_args
</pre>
<p>doesn’t work, and only in such a grammar, the next rule is used to make an
addition. Thus, the best way to think here is “In what kind of grammar would
this rule not work?” Furthermore, since a conflict only occurs when the
<code>primary</code> of <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> appears at the head of <code>call_args</code>, the scope can be
limited further and the best way to think is “In what kind of grammar does this
rule not work when a <code>tIDENTIFIER tLPAREN_ARG</code> line appears?” Below are a few
examples.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a, a)
</pre>
<p>This is a situation when the <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> list contains two or more items.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m ()
</pre>
<p>Conversely, this is a situation when the <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> list is empty.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (*args)
m (&amp;block)
m (k =&gt; v)
</pre>
<p>This is a situation when the <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code> list contains a special expression
(one not present in <code>expr</code>).</p>
<p>This should be sufficient for most cases. Now let’s compare the above with a
practical implementation.</p>
<p>▼ <code>open_args</code>(1)
<pre class="longlist">
open_args       : call_args
                | tLPAREN_ARG   &#8216;)&#8217;
</pre></p>
<p>First, the rule deals with empty lists</p>
<p>▼ <code>open_args</code>(2)
<pre class="longlist">
                | tLPAREN_ARG call_args2  &#8216;)&#8217;</p>
<p>call_args2      : arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | assocs opt_block_arg
                | assocs &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; assocs opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args &#8216;,&#8217; assocs opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; assocs &#8216;,&#8217; tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | arg_value &#8216;,&#8217; args &#8216;,&#8217; assocs &#8216;,&#8217;
                                  tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | tSTAR arg_value opt_block_arg
                | block_arg
</pre></p>
<p>And <code>call_args2</code> deals with elements containing special types such as <code>assocs</code>,
passing of arrays or passing of blocks. With this, the scope is now
sufficiently broad.</p>
<h2><code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>(2)</h2>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>In the previous section I said that the examples provided should be sufficient
for “most” special method call expressions. I said “most” because iterators are
still not covered. For example, the below statement will not work:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a) {....}
m (a) do .... end
</pre>
<p>In this section we will once again look at the previously introduced parts with
solving this problem in mind.</p>
<h3>Rule-level solution</h3>
<p>Let us start with the rules. The first part here is all familiar rules,
so focus on the <code>do_block</code> part</p>
<p>▼ <code>command_call</code>
<pre class="longlist">
command_call    : command
                | block_command</p>
<p>command         : operation command_args</p>
<p>command_args    : open_args</p>
<p>open_args       : call_args
                | tLPAREN_ARG &#8216;)&#8217;
                | tLPAREN_ARG call_args2 &#8216;)&#8217;</p>
<p>block_command   : block_call</p>
<p>block_call      : command do_block</p>
<p>do_block        : kDO_BLOCK opt_block_var compstmt &#8216;}&#8217;
                | tLBRACE_ARG opt_block_var compstmt &#8216;}&#8217;
</pre></p>
<p>Both <code>do</code> and <code>{</code> are completely new symbols <code>kDO_BLOCK</code> and <code>tLBRACE_ARG</code>.
Why isn’t it <code>kDO</code> or <code>'{'</code>  you ask? In this kind of situation the best answer
is an experiment, so we will try replacing <code>kDO_BLOCK</code> with <code>kDO</code> and
<code>tLBRACE_ARG</code> with <code>'{'</code> and processing that with <code>yacc</code></p>
<pre class="screen">
% yacc parse.y
conflicts:  2 shift/reduce, 6 reduce/reduce
</pre>
<p>It conflicts badly. A further investigation reveals that this statement is the
cause.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a), b {....}
</pre>
<p>That is because this kind of statement is already supposed to work. <code>b{....}</code>
becomes <code>primary</code>. And now a rule has been added that concatenates the block
with <code>m</code> That results in two possible interpretations:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m((a), b) {....}
m((a), (b {....}))
</pre>
<p>This is the cause of the conflict – namely, a 2 shift/reduce conflict.</p>
<p>The other conflict has to do with <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code></p>
<pre class="emlist">
m((a)) do .... end     # Add do〜end using block_call
m((a)) do .... end     # Add do〜end using primary
</pre>
<p>These two conflict. This is 6 reduce/reduce conflict.</p>
<h3><code>{</code>〜<code>}</code> iterator</h3>
<p>This is the important part. As shown previously, you can avoid a conflict by
changing the <code>do</code> and <code>'{'</code> symbols.</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-<code>'{'</code></p>
<pre class="longlist">3884        case '{':
3885          if (IS_ARG() || lex_state == EXPR_END)
3886              c = '{';          /* block (primary) */
3887          else if (lex_state == EXPR_ENDARG)
3888              c = tLBRACE_ARG;  /* block (expr) */
3889          else
3890              c = tLBRACE;      /* hash */
3891          COND_PUSH(0);
3892          CMDARG_PUSH(0);
3893          lex_state = EXPR_BEG;
3894          return c;
(parse.y)</pre>
<p><code>IS_ARG()</code> is defined as</p>
<p>▼ <code>IS_ARG</code>
<pre class="longlist">
3104  #define IS_ARG() (lex_state == EXPR_ARG || lex_state == EXPR_CMDARG)</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>Thus, when the state is  <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> it will always be false. In other words,
when <code>lex_state</code> is <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code>, it will always become <code>tLBRACE_ARG</code>, so the
key to everything is the transition to <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code>.</p>
<h4><code>EXPR_ENDARG</code></h4>
<p>Now we need to know how to set <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> I used <code>grep</code> to find where it is
assigned.</p>
<p>▼ Transition to<code>EXPR_ENDARG</code>
<pre class="longlist">
open_args       : call_args
                | tLPAREN_ARG  {lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;} &#8216;)&#8217;
                | tLPAREN_ARG call_args2 {lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;} &#8216;)&#8217;</p>
<p>primary         : tLPAREN_ARG expr {lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;} &#8216;)&#8217;
</pre></p>
<p>That’s strange. One would expect the transition to <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> to occur after
the closing parenthesis corresponding to <code>tLPAREN_ARG</code>, but it’s actually
assigned before <code>')'</code> I ran <code>grep</code> a few more times thinking there might be
other parts setting the <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> but found nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s some mistake. Maybe <code>lex_state</code> is being changed some other way.
Let’s use <code>rubylex-analyser</code> to visualize the <code>lex_state</code> transition.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% rubylex-analyser -e 'm (a) { nil }'
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C        "m"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_CMDARG

                                              1:cmd push-

EXPR_CMDARG           ")"  ')'                  EXPR_END
                                              0:cond lexpop
                                              1:cmd lexpop
+EXPR_ENDARG
EXPR_ENDARG S         "{"  tLBRACE_ARG          EXPR_BEG
                                              0:cond push
                                             10:cmd push
                                              0:cmd resume
EXPR_BEG    S       "nil"  kNIL                 EXPR_END
EXPR_END    S         "}"  '}'                  EXPR_END
                                              0:cond lexpop
                                              0:cmd lexpop
EXPR_END             "\n"  \n                   EXPR_BEG
</pre>
<p>The three big branching lines show the state transition caused by <code>yylex()</code>.
On the left is the state before <code>yylex()</code> The middle two are the word text and
its symbols. Finally, on the right is the <code>lex_state</code> after <code>yylex()</code></p>
<p>The problem here are parts of single lines that come out as <code>+EXPR_ENDARG</code>.
This indicates a transition occurring during parser action. According to this,
for some reason an action is executed after reading the <code>')'</code> a transition to
<code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> occurs and <code>'{'</code> is nicely changed into <code>tLBRACE_ARG</code> This is
actually a pretty high-level technique – indiscriminately (ab)using
the <acronym title="1"><span class="caps">LALR</span></acronym> up to the (1).</p>
<h4>Abusing the lookahead</h4>
<p><code>ruby -y</code> can bring up a detailed display of the <code>yacc</code> parser engine.
This time we will use it to more closely trace the parser.</p>
<pre class="screen">

</pre>
<p>Here we’re using the option <code>-c</code> which stops the process at just compiling and
<code>-e</code> which allows to give a program from the command line. And we’re using
<code>grep</code> to single out token read and reduction reports.</p>
<p>Start by looking at the middle of the list. <code>')'</code> is read. Now look at the end
– the reduction (execution) of embedding action (<code>@9</code>) finally happens. Indeed,
this would allow <code>EXPR_ENDARG </code> to be set after the <code>')'</code> before the <code>'{'</code>
But is this always the case? Let’s take another look at the part where it’s set.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
Rule 1    tLPAREN_ARG  {lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;} ')'
Rule 2    tLPAREN_ARG call_args2 {lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;} ')'
Rule 3    tLPAREN_ARG expr {lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;} ')'
</pre>
<p>The embedding action can be substituted with an empty rule. For example,
we can rewrite this using rule 1 with no change in meaning whatsoever.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
target  : tLPAREN_ARG tmp ')'
tmp     :
            {
                lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;
            }
</pre>
<p>Assuming that this is before <code>tmp</code>, it’s possible that one terminal symbol will
be read by lookahead. Thus we can skip the (empty) <code>tmp</code> and read the next.
And if we are certain that lookahead will occur, the assignment to <code>lex_state</code>
is guaranteed to change to <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> after <code>')'</code>
But is <code>')'</code> certain to be read by lookahead in this rule?</p>
<h4>Ascertaining lookahead</h4>
<p>This is actually pretty clear. Think about the following input.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m () { nil }        # A
m (a) { nil }       # B
m (a,b,c) { nil }   # C
</pre>
<p>I also took the opportunity to rewrite the rule to make it easier to understand
(with no actual changes).</p>
<pre class="emlist">
rule1: tLPAREN_ARG             e1  ')'
rule2: tLPAREN_ARG  one_arg    e2  ')'
rule3: tLPAREN_ARG  more_args  e3  ')'

e1:   /* empty */
e2:   /* empty */
e3:   /* empty */
</pre>
<p>First, the case of input A. Reading up to</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (         # ... tLPAREN_ARG
</pre>
<p>we arrive before the <code>e1</code>. If <code>e1</code> is reduced here, another rule cannot be
chosen anymore. Thus, a lookahead occurs to confirm whether to reduce <code>e1</code> and
continue with <code>rule1</code> to the bitter end or to choose a different rule.
Accordingly, if the input matches <code>rule1</code> it is certain that <code>')'</code> will be read
by lookahead.</p>
<p>On to input B. First, reading up to here</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (         # ... tLPAREN_ARG
</pre>
<p>Here a lookahead occurs for the same reason as described above.
Further reading up to here</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a        # ... tLPAREN_ARG '(' tIDENTIFIER
</pre>
<p>Another lookahead occurs. It occurs because depending on whether what follows
is a <code>','</code> or a <code>')'</code> a decision is made between <code>rule2</code> and <code>rule3</code> If what
follows is a <code>','</code> then it can only be a comma to separate parameters, thus
<code>rule3</code> the rule for two or more parameters, is chosen. This is also true if
the input is not a simple <code>a</code> but something like an <code>if</code> or literal.  When the
input is complete, a lookahead occurs to choose between <code>rule2</code> and <code>rule3</code> -
the rules for one parameter and two or more parameters respectively.</p>
<p>The presence of a separate embedding action is present before <code>')'</code> in every
rule. There’s no going back after an action is executed, so the parser will try
to postpone executing an action until it is as certain as possible. For that
reason, situations when this certainty cannot be gained with a single lookahead
should be excluded when building a parser as it is a conflict.</p>
<p>Proceeding to input C.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a, b, c
</pre>
<p>At this point anything other than <code>rule3</code> is unlikely so we’re not expecting a
lookahead. And yet, that is wrong. If the following is <code>'('</code> then it’s a method
call, but if the following is <code>','</code> or <code>')'</code> it needs to be a variable
reference. Basically, this time a lookahead is needed to confirm parameter
elements instead of embedding action reduction.</p>
<p>But what about the other inputs? For example, what if the third parameter is a
method call?</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a, b, c(....)    # ... ',' method_call
</pre>
<p>Once again a lookahead is necessary because a choice needs to be made between
shift and reduction depending on whether what follows is <code>','</code> or <code>')'</code>. Thus,
in this rule in all instances the <code>')'</code> is read before the embedding action is
executed. This is quite complicated and more than a little impressive.</p>
<p>But would it be possible to set <code>lex_state</code> using a normal action instead of an
embedding action? For example, like this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
                | tLPAREN_ARG ')' { lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG; }
</pre>
<p>This won’t do because another lookahead is likely to occur before the action is
reduced. This time the lookahead works to our disadvantage. With this it should
be clear that abusing the lookahead of a <span class="caps">LALR</span> parser is pretty tricky and not
something a novice should be doing.</p>
<h3><code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> iterator</h3>
<p>So far we’ve dealt with the <code>{</code>〜<code>}</code> iterator, but we still have <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code>
left. Since they’re both iterators, one would expect the same solutions to work,
but it isn’t so. The priorities are different. For example,</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m a, b {....}          # m(a, (b{....}))
m a, b do .... end     # m(a, b) do....end
</pre>
<p>Thus it’s only appropriate to deal with them differently.</p>
<p>That said, in some situations the same solutions do apply.
The example below is one such situation</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m (a) {....}
m (a) do .... end
</pre>
<p>In the end, our only option is to look at the real thing.
Since we’re dealing with <code>do</code> here, we should look in the part of <code>yylex()</code>
that handles reserved words.</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-Identifiers-Reserved words-<code>do</code>
<pre class="longlist">

<p>This time we only need the part that distinguishes between <code>kDO_BLOCK</code> and <code>kDO</code>.
Ignore <code>kDO_COND</code> Only look at what’s always relevant in a finite-state scanner.</p>
<p>The decision-making part using <code>EXPR_ENDARG</code> is the same as  <code>tLBRACE_ARG</code> so
priorities shouldn’t be an issue here. Similarly to <code>'{'</code> the right course of
action is probably to make it <code>kDO_BLOCK</code></p>
<p>The problem lies with <code>CMDARG_P()</code> and <code>EXPR_CMDARG</code>. Let’s look at both.</p>
<h4><code>CMDARG_P()</code></h4>
<p>▼ <code>cmdarg_stack</code>
<pre class="longlist">
  91  static stack_type cmdarg_stack = 0;
  92  #define CMDARG_PUSH(n) (cmdarg_stack = (cmdarg_stack&lt;&lt;1)|((n)&amp;1))
  93  #define CMDARG_POP() (cmdarg_stack &gt;&gt;= 1)
  94  #define CMDARG_LEXPOP() do {\
  95      int last = CMDARG_P();\
  96      cmdarg_stack &gt;&gt;= 1;\
  97      if (last) cmdarg_stack |= 1;\
  98  } while (0)
  99  #define CMDARG_P() (cmdarg_stack&amp;1)</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>The structure and interface (macro) of <code>cmdarg_stack</code> is completely identical
to <code>cond_stack</code>. It’s a stack of bits. Since it’s the same, we can use the same
means to investigate it. Let’s list up the places which use it.
First, during the action we have this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
command_args    :  {
                        $&lt;num&gt;$ = cmdarg_stack;
                        CMDARG_PUSH(1);
                    }
                  open_args
                    {
                        /* CMDARG_POP() */
                        cmdarg_stack = $&lt;num&gt;1;
                        $$ = $2;
                    }
</pre>
<p><code>$&lt;num&gt;$</code> represents the left value with a forced casting. In this case it
comes out as the value of the embedding action itself, so it can be produced in
the next action with <code>$&lt;num&gt;1</code>. Basically, it’s a structure where <code>cmdarg_stack</code>
is hidden in <code>$$</code> before <code>open_args</code> and then restored in the next action.</p>
<p>But why use a hide-restore system instead of a simple push-pop? That will be
explained at the end of this section.</p>
<p>Searching <code>yylex()</code> for more <code>CMDARG</code> relations, I found this.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Token           </th>
		<th>Relation </th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <code>'('  '['  '{'</code> </td>
		<td> <code>CMDARG_PUSH(0)</code> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> <code>')'  ']'  '}'</code> </td>
		<td> <code>CMDARG_LEXPOP()</code> </td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Basically, as long as it is enclosed in parentheses, <code>CMDARG_P()</code> is false.</p>
<p>Consider both, and it can be said that when <code>command_args</code> , a parameter for a
method call with parentheses omitted, is not enclosed in parentheses
<code>CMDARG_P()</code> is true.</p>
<h4><code>EXPR_CMDARG</code></h4>
<p>Now let’s take a look at one more condition &#8211; <code>EXPR_CMDARG</code>
Like before, let us look for place where a transition to <code>EXPR_CMDARG</code> occurs.</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-Identifiers-State Transitions
<pre class="longlist">
4201              if (lex_state == EXPR_BEG ||
4202                  lex_state == EXPR_MID ||
4203                  lex_state == EXPR_DOT ||
4204                  lex_state == EXPR_ARG ||
4205                  lex_state == EXPR_CMDARG) {
4206                  if (cmd_state)
4207                      lex_state = EXPR_CMDARG;
4208                  else
4209                      lex_state = EXPR_ARG;
4210              }
4211              else {
4212                  lex_state = EXPR_END;
4213              }</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>This is code that handles identifiers inside <code>yylex()</code>
Leaving aside that there are a bunch of <code>lex_state</code> tests in here, let’s look
first at <code>cmd_state</code>
And what is this?</p>
<p>▼ <code>cmd_state</code>
<pre class="longlist">
3106  static int
3107  yylex()
3108  {
3109      static ID last_id = 0;
3110      register int c;
3111      int space_seen = 0;
3112      int cmd_state;
3113
3114      if (lex_strterm) {
              /* ……omitted…… */
3132      }
3133      cmd_state = command_start;
3134      command_start = Qfalse;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>Turns out it’s an <code>yylex</code> local variable. Furthermore, an investigation using
<code>grep</code> revealed that here is the only place where its value is altered. This
means it’s just a temporary variable for storing <code>command_start</code> during a
single run of <code>yylex</code></p>
<p>When does <code>command_start</code> become true, then?</p>
<p>▼ <code>command_start</code>
<pre class="longlist">
2327  static int command_start = Qtrue;</p>
<p>2334  static NODE*
2335  yycompile(f, line)
2336      char *f;
2337      int line;
2338  {
                   :
2380      command_start = 1;</p>
<p>      static int
      yylex()
      {
                   :
            case &#8216;\n&#8217;:
              /* ……omitted…… */
3165          command_start = Qtrue;
3166          lex_state = EXPR_BEG;
3167          return &#8216;\n&#8217;;</p>
<p>3821        case &#8216;;&#8217;:
3822          command_start = Qtrue;</p>
<p>3841        case &#8216;(&#8217;:
3842          command_start = Qtrue;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>From this we understand that <code>command_start</code> becomes true when one of the
<code>parse.y</code> static variables <code>\n ; (</code> is scanned.</p>
<p>Summing up what we’ve covered up to now, first, when <code>\n ; (</code> is read,
<code>command_start</code> becomes true and during the next <code>yylex()</code> run <code>cmd_state</code>
becomes true.</p>
<p>And here is the code in <code>yylex()</code> that uses <code>cmd_state</code></p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-Identifiers-State transitions
<pre class="longlist">
4201              if (lex_state == EXPR_BEG ||
4202                  lex_state == EXPR_MID ||
4203                  lex_state == EXPR_DOT ||
4204                  lex_state == EXPR_ARG ||
4205                  lex_state == EXPR_CMDARG) {
4206                  if (cmd_state)
4207                      lex_state = EXPR_CMDARG;
4208                  else
4209                      lex_state = EXPR_ARG;
4210              }
4211              else {
4212                  lex_state = EXPR_END;
4213              }</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>From this we understand the following: when after <code>\n ; (</code> the state is
<code>EXPR_BEG MID DOT ARG CMDARG</code> and an identifier is read, a transition to
<code>EXPR_CMDARG</code> occurs. However, <code>lex_state</code> can only become <code>EXPR_BEG</code> following
a <code>\n ; (</code> so when a transition occurs to <code>EXPR_CMDARG</code> the <code>lex_state</code> loses
its meaning. The <code>lex_state</code> restriction is only important to transitions
dealing with <code>EXPR_ARG</code></p>
<p>Based on the above we can now think of a situation where the state is
<code>EXPR_CMDARG</code>. For example, see the one below. The underscore is the current
position.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m _
m(m _
m m _
</pre>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Let us now return to the <code>do</code> decision code.</p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-Identifiers-Reserved words-<code>kDO</code>-<code>kDO_BLOCK</code>
<pre class="longlist">
4185                          if (CMDARG_P() &amp;&amp; state != EXPR_CMDARG)
4186                              return kDO_BLOCK;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>Inside the parameter of a method call with parentheses omitted but not before
the first parameter. That means from the second parameter of <code>command_call</code>
onward. Basically, like this:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m arg, arg do .... end
m (arg), arg do .... end
</pre>
<p>Why is the case of <code>EXPR_CMDARG</code> excluded?  This example should clear It up</p>
<pre class="emlist">
m do .... end
</pre>
<p>This pattern can already be handled using the <code>do</code>〜<code>end</code> iterator which uses
<code>kDO</code> and is defined in <code>primary</code> Thus, including that case would cause another
conflict.</p>
<h3>Reality and truth</h3>
<p>Did you think we’re done? Not yet.
Certainly, the theory is now complete, but only if everything that has been
written is correct.
As a matter of fact, there is one falsehood in this section.
Well, more accurately, it isn’t a falsehood but an inexact statement.
It’s in the part about <code>CMDARG_P()</code></p>
<div class="center">
<p>Actually, <code>CMDARG_P()</code> becomes true when inside <code>command_args</code> , that is to say,
inside the parameter of a method call with parentheses omitted.</p>
</div>
<p>But where exactly is “inside the parameter of a method call with parentheses
omitted”? Once again, let us use <code>rubylex-analyser</code> to inspect in detail.</p>
<pre class="screen">
% rubylex-analyser -e  'm a,a,a,a;'
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C        "m"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_CMDARG

EXPR_ARG              ","  ','                  EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG              "a"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_ARG

</pre>
<p>The <code>1:cmd push-</code> in the right column is the push to <code>cmd_stack</code>. When the
rightmost digit in that line is 1 <code>CMDARG_P()</code> become true. To sum up, the
period of <code>CMDARG_P()</code> can be described as:</p>
<div class="center">
<p>From immediately after the first parameter of a method call with parentheses omitted
To the terminal symbol following the final parameter</p>
</div>
<p>But, very strictly speaking, even this is still not entirely accurate.</p>
<pre class="screen">

</pre>
<p>When the first terminal symbol of the first parameter has been read,
<code>CMDARG_P()</code> is true. Therefore, the complete answer would be:</p>
<div class="center">
<p>From the first terminal symbol of the first parameter of a method call with parentheses omitted
To the terminal symbol following the final parameter</p>
</div>
<p>What repercussions does this fact have? Recall the code that uses <code>CMDARG_P()</code></p>
<p>▼ <code>yylex</code>-Identifiers-Reserved words-<code>kDO</code>-<code>kDO_BLOCK</code>
<pre class="longlist">
4185                          if (CMDARG_P() &amp;&amp; state != EXPR_CMDARG)
4186                              return kDO_BLOCK;</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p><code>EXPR_CMDARG</code> stands for “Before the first parameter of <code>command_call</code>” and is
excluded. But wait, this meaning is also included in <code>CMDARG_P()</code>.
Thus, the final conclusion of this section:</p>
<div class="center">
<p>EXPR_CMDARG is completely useless</p>
</div>
<p>Truth be told, when I realized this, I almost broke down crying. I was sure it
had to mean <span class="caps">SOMETHING</span> and spent enormous effort analyzing the source, but
couldn’t understand anything. Finally, I ran all kind of tests on the code
using <code>rubylex-analyser</code> and arrived at the conclusion that it has no meaning
whatsoever.</p>
<p>I didn’t spend so much time doing something meaningless just to fill up more
pages. It was an attempt to simulate a situation likely to happen in reality.
No program is perfect, all programs contain their own mistakes. Complicated
situations like the one discussed here are where mistakes occur most easily,
and when they do, reading the source material with the assumption that it’s
flawless can really backfire. In the end, when reading the source code, you can
only trust the what actually happens.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will teach you the importance of dynamic analysis. When
investigating something, focus on what really happens. The source code will not
tell you everything. It can’t tell anything other than what the reader infers.</p>
<p>And with this very useful sermon, I close the chapter.</p>
<h4>Still not the end</h4>
<p>Another thing I forgot. I can’t  end the chapter without explaining why
<code>CMDARG_P()</code> takes that value. Here’s the problematic part:</p>
<p>▼ <code>command_args</code>
<pre class="longlist">
1209  command_args    :  {
1210                          $<num>$ = cmdarg_stack;
1211                          CMDARG_PUSH(1);
1212                      }
1213                    open_args
1214                      {
1215                          /* CMDARG_POP() */
1216                          cmdarg_stack = $<num>1;
1217                          $$ = $2;
1218                      }</p>
<p>1221  open_args       : call_args</p>
<p>(parse.y)
</pre></p>
<p>All things considered, this looks like another influence from lookahead.
<code>command_args</code> is always in the following context:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
tIDENTIFIER _
</pre>
<p>Thus, this looks like a variable reference or a method call. If it’s a variable
reference, it needs to be reduced to <code>variable</code> and if it’s a method call it
needs to be reduced to <code>operation</code> We cannot decide how to proceed without
employing lookahead. Thus a lookahead always occurs at the head of
<code>command_args</code> and after the first terminal symbol of the first parameter is
read, <code>CMDARG_PUSH()</code> is executed.</p>
<p>The reason why <code>POP</code> and <code>LEXPOP</code> exist separately in <code>cmdarg_stack</code> is also
here. Observe the following example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
% rubylex-analyser -e 'm m (a), a'
-e:1: warning: parenthesize argument(s) for future version
+EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG     C        "m"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_CMDARG

                                            101:cmd push-

                                              0:cond lexpop
                                             11:cmd lexpop
+EXPR_ENDARG
EXPR_ENDARG           ","  ','                  EXPR_BEG
EXPR_BEG    S         "a"  tIDENTIFIER          EXPR_ARG
EXPR_ARG             "\n"  \n                   EXPR_BEG
                                             10:cmd resume
                                              0:cmd resume
</pre>
<p>Looking only at the parts related to <code>cmd</code> and how they correspond to each other…</p>
<pre class="emlist">
  1:cmd push-       parserpush(1)
 10:cmd push        scannerpush
101:cmd push-       parserpush(2)
 11:cmd lexpop      scannerpop
 10:cmd resume      parserpop(2)
  0:cmd resume      parserpop(1)
</pre>
<p>The <code>cmd push-</code> with a minus sign at the end is a parser push. Basically,
<code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> do not correspond. Originally there were supposed to be two
consecutive <code>push-</code> and the stack would become 110, but due to the lookahead
the stack became 101 instead. <code>CMDARG_LEXPOP()</code> is a last-resort measure to
deal with this. The scanner always pushes 0 so normally what it pops should
also always be 0. When it isn’t 0, we can only assume that it’s 1 due to the
parser <code>push</code> being late. Thus, the value is left.</p>
<p>Conversely, at the time of the parser <code>pop</code> the stack is supposed to be back in
normal state and usually <code>pop</code> shouldn’t cause any trouble. When it doesn’t do
that, the reason is basically that it should work right. Whether popping or
hiding in <code>$$</code> and restoring, the process is the same. When you consider all
the following alterations, it’s really impossible to tell how lookahead’s
behavior will change. Moreover, this problem appears in a grammar that’s going
to be forbidden in the future (that’s why there is a warning). To make
something like this work, the trick is to consider numerous possible situations
and respond them. And that is why I think this kind of implementation is right
for Ruby. Therein lies the real solution.</p>
