<h1>Chapter 5: Garbage Collection</h1>
<h2>A conception of an executing program</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s all of a sudden but at the beginning of this chapter, we&#8217;ll
learn about the memory space of an executing program. In this chapter
we&#8217;ll step inside the lower level parts of a computer quite a bit, so without
preliminary knowledge it&#8217;ll be hard to follow. And it&#8217;ll be also necessary
for the following chapters.
Once we finish this here, the rest will be easier.</p>
<h3>Memory Segments</h3>
<p>A general C program has the following parts in the memory space:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the text area</li>
	<li>a place for static and global variables</li>
	<li>the machine stack</li>
	<li>the heap</li>
</ol>
<p>The text area is where the code lies. Obviously the second area holds static and global variables.
Arguments and local variables of functions are piling up in the machine stack.
The heap is the place where allocated by <code>malloc()</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk a bit more about number three, the machine stack.
Since it is called the machine &#8220;stack&#8221;,
obviously it has a stack structure.
In other words, new stuff is piled on top of it one after another.
When we actually pushes values on the stack, each value would be a tiny piece
such as <code>int</code>. But logically, there are a little larger pieces.
They are called stack frames.</p>
<p>One stack frame corresponds to one function call. Or in other words when there
is a function call, one stack frame is pushed.
When doing <code>return</code>, one stack frame will be popped.
Figure 1 shows the really simplified appearance of the machine stack.</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_macstack.jpg" alt="(macstack)"><br>
Figure 1: Machine Stack</p>
<ul>
	<li>上（先端）above (top)</li>
	<li>下（末端）below (bottom)</li>
	<li>スタックフレーム stack frame</li>
	<li>現在実行中の関数フレーム presently executing function frame
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>In this picture, &#8220;above&#8221; is written above the top of the stack,
but this it is not necessarily always the case that the machine stack goes
from low addresses to high addresses. For instance, on the x86
machine the stack goes from high to low addresses.</p>
<h3><code>alloca()</code></h3>
<p>By using <code>malloc()</code>, we can get an arbitrarily large memory
area of the heap. <code>alloca()</code> is the machine stack version of it.
But unlike <code>malloc()</code> it&#8217;s not necessary to free the memory allocated
with <code>alloca()</code>. Or one should say:
it is freed automatically at the same moment of <code>return</code> of each function.
That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not possible to use an allocated value as the return
value. It&#8217;s the same as &#8220;You must not return the pointer to
a local variable.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been not any difficulty. We can consider it something to locally
allocate an array whose size can be changed at runtime.</p>
<p>However there exist environments where there is no native <code>alloca()</code>.
There are still many who would like to use <code>alloca()</code> even if in such
environment, sometimes a function to do the same thing is written in C.
But in that case, only the feature that we don&#8217;t have to free it by ourselves
is implemented and it does not necessarily allocate the memory on the machine
stack. In fact, it often does not.
If it were possible, a native
<code>alloca()</code> could have been implemented in the first place.</p>
<p>How can one implement <code>alloca()</code> in C? The simplest implementation is:
first allocate memory normally with <code>malloc()</code>. Then remember the pair of the function
which called <code>alloca()</code> and the assigned addresses in a global list.
After that, check this list whenever <code>alloca()</code> is called,
if there are the memories allocated for the functions already finished,
free them by using <code>free()</code>.</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_calloca.jpg" alt="(calloca)"><br>
Figure 2: The behavior of an <code>alloca()</code> implemented in C</p>
<ul>
	<li>D&#8594;alloca(8)の対応を記録 record the relation D&#8594; alloca(8)</li>
	<li>B&#8594;alloca(32)の対応を記録 record the relation B&#8594; alloca(32)</li>
	<li>Dで割り当てたメモりを解放 release the memory allocated in D
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>missing/alloca.c</code> of <code>ruby</code> is an example of an emulated <code>alloca()</code> .</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>From here on we can at last talk about the main subject of this chapter:
garbage collection.</p>
<h3>What is GC?</h3>
<p>Objects are normally on top of the memory. Naturally, if a lot of objects are created, a lot of memory is used. If memory
were infinite there would be no problem, but in reality there is always a memory
limit. That&#8217;s why the memory which is not
used anymore must be collected and recycled. More concretely the memory received through <code>malloc()</code> must be returned with
<code>free()</code>.</p>
<p>However, it would require a lot of efforts if the management of <code>malloc()</code> and
<code>free()</code> were entirely left to programmers.
Especially in object oriented programs, because objects are referring each other,
it is difficult to tell when to release memory.</p>
<p>There garbage collection comes in.
Garbage Collection (GC) is a feature to automatically detect and free the memory
which has become unnecessary.
With garbage collection,
the worry &#8220;When should I have to <code>free()</code> ??&#8221; has become unnecessary.
Between when it exists and when it does not exist,
the ease of writing programs differs considerably.</p>
<p>By the way, in a book about something that I&#8217;ve read,
there&#8217;s a description &#8220;the thing to tidy up the fragmented usable memory is GC&#8221;.
This task is called &#8220;compaction&#8221;.
It is compaction because it makes a thing compact.
Because compaction makes memory cache more often hit,
it has effects for speed-up to some extent,
but it is not the main purpose of GC.
The purpose of GC is to collect memory. There are many GCs which collect
memories but don&#8217;t do compaction.
The GC of <code>ruby</code> also does not do compaction.</p>
<p>Then, in what kind of system is GC available?
In C and C++, there&#8217;s
Boehm GC\footnote{Boehm GC <code>http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc</code>}
which can be used as an add-on.
And, for the recent languages such as Java and Perl, Python, C#, Eiffel,
GC is a standard equipment. And of course, Ruby has its GC.
Let&#8217;s follow the details of <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s GC in this chapter.
The target file is <code>gc.c</code>.</p>
<h3>What does GC do?</h3>
<p>Before explaining the GC algorithm, I should explain &#8220;what garbage collection
is&#8221;.
In other words, what kind of state of the memory is &#8220;the unnecessary memory&#8221;?</p>
<p>To make descriptions more concrete,
let&#8217;s simplify the structure by assuming that there are only objects and links.
This would look as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_objects.jpg" alt="(objects)"><br>
Figure 3: Objects</p>
</p>
<p>The objects pointed to by global variables and the objects on the stack of a
language are surely necessary. And objects pointed to by instance variables of
these objects are also necessary. Furthermore, the objects that are reachable by
following links from these objects are also necessary.</p>
<p>To put it more logically, the necessary objects are all objects which
can be reached recursively via links from the &#8220;surely necessary objects&#8221; as
the start points.
This is depicted in figure 4. What are on the left of the line are all &#8220;surely necessary objects&#8221;,
and the objects which can be reached from them are colored black.
These objects colored black are the
necessary objects. The rest of the objects can be released.</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_gcimage.jpg" alt="(gcimage)"><br>
Figure 4: necessary objects and unnecessary objects</p>
<ul>
	<li>ルートオブジェクト　root objects</li>
	<li>不要なオブジェクト unnecessary objects</li>
	<li>ルートオブジェクトから参照されているオブジェクト objects referenced by the
  root objects
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>In technical terms, &#8220;the surely necessary objects&#8221; are called &#8220;the roots of GC&#8221;.
That&#8217;s because they are the roots of tree structures that emerges as a
consequence of tracing necessary objects.</p>
<h3>Mark and Sweep</h3>
<p>GC was first implemented in Lisp.
The GC implemented in Lisp at first,
it means the world&#8217;s first GC,
is called mark&amp;sweep GC.
The GC of <code>ruby</code> is one type of it.</p>
<p>The image of Mark-and-Sweep GC is pretty close to our definition of &#8220;necessary
object&#8221;. First, put &#8220;marks&#8221; on the root objects. Setting them as the start
points, put &#8220;marks&#8221; on all reachable objects.
This is the mark phase.</p>
<p>At the moment when there&#8217;s not any reachable object left,
check all objects in the object pool, release (sweep) all objects that have not marked.
&#8220;Sweep&#8221; is the &#8220;sweep&#8221; of Minesweeper.</p>
<p>There are two advantages.</p>
<ul>
	<li>There does not need to be any (or almost any) concern for garbage collection
outside the implementation of GC.</li>
	<li>Cycles can also be released. (As for cycles, see also the section of &#8220;Reference Count&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also two disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In order to sweep every object must be touched at least once.</li>
	<li>The load of the GC is concentrated at one point.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the emacs editor, there sometimes appears &quot; <code>Garbage collecting...</code> &quot;
and it completely stops reacting. That is an example of the second disadvantage.
But this point can be alleviated by modifying the algorithm (it is called incremental GC).</p>
<h3>Stop and Copy</h3>
<p>Stop and Copy is a variation of Mark and Sweep. First, prepare several object
areas. To simplify this description, assume there are two areas <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> here.
And put an &#8220;active&#8221; mark on the one of the areas.
When creating an object, create it only in the &#8220;active&#8221; one. (Figure 5)</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_stop2.jpg" alt="(stop2)"><br>
Figure 5: Stop and Copy (1)</p>
</p>
<p>When the GC starts, follow links from the roots in the same manner as
mark-and-sweep. However, move objects to another area instead of marking them
(Figure 6). When all the links have been followed, discard the all elements
which remain in <code>A</code>, and make <code>B</code> active next.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_stop3.jpg" alt="(stop3)"><br>
Figure 6: Stop and Copy (2)</p>
</p>
<p>Stop and Copy also has two advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Compaction happens at the same time as collecting the memory</li>
	<li>Since objects that reference each other move closer together,
  there&#8217;s more possibility of hitting the cache.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also two disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The object area needs to be more than twice as big</li>
	<li>The positions of objects will be changed</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems what exist in this world are not only positive things.</p>
<h3>Reference counting</h3>
<p>Reference counting differs a bit from the aforementioned GCs,
the reach-check code is distributed in several places.</p>
<p>First, attach an integer count to each element.
When referring via variables or arrays, the counter of the referenced object is
increased. When quitting to refer, decrease the counter.
When the counter of an object becomes zero, release the object.
This is the method called reference counting (Figure 7).</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_refcnt.jpg" alt="(refcnt)"><br>
Figure 7: Reference counting</p>
</p>
<p>This method also has two advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The load of GC is distributed over the entire program.</li>
	<li>The object that becomes unnecessary is immediately freed.</li>
</ul>
<p>And also two disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The counter handling tends to be forgotten.</li>
	<li>When doing it naively cycles are not released.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain about the second point just in case. A cycle is
a cycle of references as shown in Figure 8.
If this is the case the counters will never decrease
and the objects will never be released.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_cycle.jpg" alt="(cycle)"><br>
Figure 8: Cycle</p>
</p>
<p>By the way, latest Python(2.2) uses reference counting GC but it can free cycles.
However, it is not because of the reference counting itself,
but because it sometimes invokes mark and sweep GC to check.</p>
<h2>Object Management</h2>
<p>Ruby&#8217;s garbage collection is only concerned with ruby objects.
Moreover, it only concerned with the objects created and managed by <code>ruby</code>.
Conversely speaking,
if the memory is allocated without following a certain procedure,
it won&#8217;t be taken care of.
For instance, the following function will cause a memory leak
even if <code>ruby</code> is running.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
void not_ok()
{
    malloc(1024);  /* receive memory and discard it */
}
</pre>
<p>However, the following function does not cause a memory leak.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
void this_is_ok()
{
    rb_ary_new();  /* create a ruby array and discard it */
}
</pre>
<p>Since <code>rb_ary_new()</code> uses Ruby&#8217;s proper interface to allocate memory,
the created object is under the management of the GC of <code>ruby</code>,
thus <code>ruby</code> will take care of it.</p>
<h3><code>struct RVALUE</code></h3>
<p>Since the substance of an object is a struct,
managing objects means managing that structs.
Of course the non-pointer objects like <code>Fixnum Symbol nil true false</code> are
exceptions, but I won&#8217;t always describe about it to prevent descriptions
from being redundant.</p>
<p>Each struct type has its different size,
but probably in order to keep management simpler,
a union of all the structs of built-in classes is declared and
the union is always used when dealing with memory.
The declaration of that union is as follows.</p>
<p>▼ <code>RVALUE</code></p>
<pre class="longlist">
 211  typedef struct RVALUE {
 212      union {
 213          struct {
 214              unsigned long flags;   /* 0 if not used */
 215              struct RVALUE *next;
 216          } free;
 217          struct RBasic  basic;
 218          struct RObject object;
 219          struct RClass  klass;
 220          struct RFloat  flonum;
 221          struct RString string;
 222          struct RArray  array;
 223          struct RRegexp regexp;
 224          struct RHash   hash;
 225          struct RData   data;
 226          struct RStruct rstruct;
 227          struct RBignum bignum;
 228          struct RFile   file;
 229          struct RNode   node;
 230          struct RMatch  match;
 231          struct RVarmap varmap;
 232          struct SCOPE   scope;
 233      } as;
 234  } RVALUE;

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p><code>struct RVALUE</code> is a struct that has only one element.
I&#8217;ve heard that the reason why <code>union</code> is not directly used is to enable to
easily increase its members when debugging or when extending in the future.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s focus on the first element of the union <code>free.flags</code>. The comment
says &#8220;<code>0</code> if not used&#8221;, but is it true?
Is there not any possibility for <code>free.flags</code> to be <code>0</code> by chance?</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in Chapter 2: Objects, all object structs have <code>struct RBasic</code> as its first
element. Therefore, by whichever element of the union we access,
<code>obj-&gt;as.free.flags</code> means the same as it is written as <code>obj-&gt;as.basic.flags</code>.
And objects always have the struct-type flag (such as <code>T_STRING</code>),
and the flag is always not <code>0</code>. Therefore, the flag of an &#8220;alive&#8221; object will
never coincidentally be <code>0</code>.
Hence, we can confirm that setting their flags to <code>0</code>
is necessity and sufficiency to represent &#8220;dead&#8221; objects.</p>
<h3>Object heap</h3>
<p>The memory for all the object structs has been brought together in global variable <code>heaps</code>.
Hereafter, let&#8217;s call this an object heap.</p>
<p>▼ Object heap</p>
<pre class="longlist">
 239  #define HEAPS_INCREMENT 10
 240  static RVALUE **heaps;
 241  static int heaps_length = 0;
 242  static int heaps_used   = 0;
 243
 244  #define HEAP_MIN_SLOTS 10000
 245  static int *heaps_limits;
 246  static int heap_slots = HEAP_MIN_SLOTS;

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p><code>heaps</code> is an array of arrays of <code>struct RVALUE</code>. Since it is <code>heapS</code>,
the each contained array is probably each <code>heap</code>.
Each element of <code>heap</code> is each <code>slot</code> (Figure 9).</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_heapitems.jpg" alt="(heapitems)"><br>
Figure 9: <code>heaps</code>, <code>heap</code>, <code>slot</code></p>
</p>
<p>The length of <code>heaps</code> is <code>heap_length</code> and it can be changed. The number of
the slots actually in use is <code>heaps_used</code>. The length of each heap
is in the corresponding <code>heaps_limits[index]</code>.
Figure 10 shows the structure of the object heap.</p>
<p class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_heaps.jpg" alt="(heaps)"><br>
Figure 10: conceptual diagram of <code>heaps</code> in memory</p>
</p>
<p>This structure has a necessity to be this way.
For instance, if all structs are stored in an array,
the memory space would be the most compact,
but we cannot do <code>realloc()</code> because it could change the addresses.
This is because <code>VALUE</code>s are mere pointers.</p>
<p>In the case of an implementation of Java,
the counterpart of <code>VALUE</code>s are not addresses but the indexes of objects.
Since they are handled through a pointer table, objects are movable.
However in this case, indexing of the array comes in every time
an object access occurs and it lowers the performance in some degree.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what happens if it is an one-dimensional array of pointers
to <code>RVALUE</code>s (it means <code>VALUE</code>s)?
This seems to be able to go well at the first glance, but it does not when GC.
That is, as I&#8217;ll describe in detail, the GC of <code>ruby</code> needs to know the
integers &quot;which seems <code>VALUE</code> (the pointers to <code>RVALUE</code>).
If all <code>RVALUE</code> are allocated in addresses which are far from each other,
it needs to compare all address of <code>RVALUE</code> with all integers &#8220;which could be
pointers&#8221;.
This means the time for GC becomes the order more than O(n^2),
and not acceptable.</p>
<p>According to these requirements, it is good that the object heap form a
structure that the addresses are cohesive to some extent
and whose position and total amount are not restricted at the same time.</p>
<h3><code>freelist</code></h3>
<p>Unused <code>RVALUE</code>s are managed by being linked as a single line which is a linked
list that starts with <code>freelist</code>.
The <code>as.free.next</code> of <code>RVALUE</code> is the link used for this purpose.</p>
<p>▼ <code>freelist</code></p>
<pre class="longlist">
 236  static RVALUE *freelist = 0;

(gc.c)
</pre>
<h3><code>add_heap()</code></h3>
<p>As we understood the data structure,
let&#8217;s read the function <code>add_heap()</code> to add a heap.
Because this function contains a lot of lines not part of the main line,
I&#8217;ll show the one simplified by omitting error handlings and castings.</p>
<p>▼ <code>add_heap()</code> (simplified)</p>
<pre class="longlist">
static void
add_heap()
{
    RVALUE *p, *pend;

    /* extend heaps if necessary */
    if (heaps_used == heaps_length) {
        heaps_length += HEAPS_INCREMENT;
        heaps        = realloc(heaps,        heaps_length * sizeof(RVALUE*));
        heaps_limits = realloc(heaps_limits, heaps_length * sizeof(int));
    }

    /* increase heaps by 1 */
    p = heaps[heaps_used] = malloc(sizeof(RVALUE) * heap_slots);
    heaps_limits[heaps_used] = heap_slots;
    pend = p + heap_slots;
    if (lomem == 0 || lomem &gt; p) lomem = p;
    if (himem &lt; pend) himem = pend;
    heaps_used++;
    heap_slots *= 1.8;

    /* link the allocated RVALUE to freelist */
    while (p &lt; pend) {
        p-&gt;as.free.flags = 0;
        p-&gt;as.free.next = freelist;
        freelist = p;
        p++;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Please check the following points.</p>
<ul>
	<li>the length of <code>heap</code> is <code>heap_slots</code></li>
	<li>the <code>heap_slots</code> becomes 1.8 times larger every time  when a <code>heap</code> is added</li>
	<li>the length of <code>heaps[i]</code> (the value of <code>heap_slots</code> when creating a heap) is
  stored in <code>heaps_limits[i]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, since <code>lomem</code> and <code>himem</code> are modified only by this function,
only by this function you can understand the mechanism.
These variables hold the lowest and the highest addresses of the object heap.
These values are used later when determining the integers &#8220;which seems <code>VALUE</code>&#8221;.</p>
<h3><code>rb_newobj()</code></h3>
<p>Considering all of the above points, we can tell the way to create an object
in a second.
If there is at least a <code>RVALUE</code> linked from <code>freelist</code>, we can use it.
Otherwise, do GC or increase the heaps.
Let&#8217;s confirm this by reading the <code>rb_newobj()</code> function to create an object.</p>
<p>▼ <code>rb_newobj()</code></p>
<pre class="longlist">
 297  VALUE
 298  rb_newobj()
 299  {
 300      VALUE obj;
 301
 302      if (!freelist) rb_gc();
 303
 304      obj = (VALUE)freelist;
 305      freelist = freelist-&gt;as.free.next;
 306      MEMZERO((void*)obj, RVALUE, 1);
 307      return obj;
 308  }

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p>If <code>freelest</code> is 0, in other words, if there&#8217;s not any unused structs,
invoke GC and create spaces.
Even if we could not collect not any object,
there&#8217;s no problem because in this case a new space is allocated in <code>rb_gc()</code>.
And take a struct from <code>freelist</code>, zerofill it by <code>MEMZERO()</code>, and return it.</p>
<h2>Mark</h2>
<p>As described, <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s GC is Mark &amp; Sweep.
Its &#8220;mark&#8221; is, concretely speaking, to set a <code>FL_MARK</code> flag:
look for unused <code>VALUE</code>, set <code>FL_MARK</code> flags to found ones,
then look at the object heap after investigating all
and free objects that <code>FL_MARK</code> has not been set.</p>
<h3><code>rb_gc_mark()</code></h3>
<p><code>rb_gc_mark()</code> is the function to mark objects recursively.</p>
<p>▼ <code>rb_gc_mark()</code></p>
<pre class="longlist">
 573  void
 574  rb_gc_mark(ptr)
 575      VALUE ptr;
 576  {
 577      int ret;
 578      register RVALUE *obj = RANY(ptr);
 579
 580      if (rb_special_const_p(ptr)) return; /* special const not marked */
 581      if (obj-&gt;as.basic.flags == 0) return;       /* free cell */
 582      if (obj-&gt;as.basic.flags &amp; FL_MARK) return;  /* already marked */

 589              if (mark_stack_ptr - mark_stack &lt; MARK_STACK_MAX) {
 590                  *mark_stack_ptr = ptr;

<p>and <code>obj</code> (this is the <code>ptr</code> parameter of this function) is marked.
Then next, it&#8217;s the turn to follow the references from <code>obj</code> and mark.

<p>The others, what starts with <code>CHECK_STACK()</code> and is written a lot is a device
to prevent the machine stack overflow.
Since <code>rb_gc_mark()</code> uses recursive calls to mark objects,
if there is a big object cluster,
it is possible to run short of the length of the machine stack.
To counter that, if the machine stack is nearly overflow,
it stops the recursive calls, piles up the objects on a global list,
and later it marks them once again.
This code is omitted because it is not part of the main line.</p>

<p>Additionally, let&#8217;s see the part to mark <code>T_DATA</code> (the struct used for extension

<h3><code>rb_gc()</code></h3>
<p>By now, we&#8217;ve finished to talk about each object.
From now on, let&#8217;s see the function <code>rb_gc()</code> that presides the whole.
The objects marked here are &#8220;objects which are obviously necessary&#8221;.
In other words, &#8220;the roots of GC&#8221;.</p>

<p>The roots which should be marked will be shown one by one after this,
but I&#8217;d like to mention just one point here.</p>
<p>In <code>ruby</code> the <span class="caps">CPU</span> registers and the machine stack are also the roots.
It means that the local variables and arguments of C are automatically marked.
For example,</p>
<pre class="emlist">
static int
f(void)
{
    VALUE arr = rb_ary_new();

    /* …… do various things …… */
}
</pre>
<p>like this way, we can protect an object just by putting it into a variable.
This is a very significant trait of the GC of <code>ruby</code>.
Because of this feature, <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s extension libraries are insanely easy to write.</p>
<p>However, what is on the stack is not only <code>VALUE</code>.
There are a lot of totally unrelated values.
How to resolve this is the key when reading the implementation of GC.</p>
<h3>The Ruby Stack</h3>
<p>First, it marks the (<code>ruby</code>&#8216;s) stack frames used by the interpretor.
Since you will be able to find out who it is after reaching Part 3,
you don&#8217;t have to think so much about it for now.</p>

<p><code>FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS</code> is special. We will see it later.</p>

but the content of the registers are saved into the argument (which is a
variable of type <code>jmp_buf</code>) as its side effect.
Making use of this, it attempts to mark the content of the registers.
Things around here really look like secret techniques.</p>
<p>However only <code>djgpp</code> and <code>Human68k</code> are specially treated.
djgpp is a <code>gcc</code> environment for <span class="caps">DOS</span>.
Human68k is an OS of <span class="caps">SHARP</span> X680x0 Series.
In these two environments, the whole registers seem to be not saved only by the
ordinary <code>setjmp()</code>, <code>setjmp()</code> is redefined as follows as an inline-assembler
to explicitly write out the registers.</p>

<p>Alignment is the constraint when putting variables on memories.
For example, in 32-bit machine <code>int</code> is usually 32 bits,
but we cannot always take 32 bits from anywhere of memories.
Particularly, <span class="caps">RISC</span> machine has strict constraints,
it is decided like &#8220;from a multiple of 4 byte&#8221; or &#8220;from even byte&#8221;.
When there are such constraints, memory access unit can be more simplified
(thus, it can be faster). When there&#8217;s the constraint of &#8220;from a multiple of 4 byte&#8221;,
it is called &#8220;4-byte alignment&#8221;.</p>
<p>Plus, in <code>cc</code> of djgpp or Human68k, there&#8217;s a rule that the compiler put the
underline to the head of each function name.
Therefore, when writing a C function in Assembler, we need to put the underline
(<code>_</code>) to its head by ourselves.
This type of constraints are techniques in order to avoid the conflicts in
names with library functions.
Also in <span class="caps">UNIX</span>, it is said that the underline had been attached by some time ago,
but it almost disappears now.</p>
<p>Now, the content of the registers has been able to be written out into <code>jmp_buf</code>,
it will be marked in the next code:</p>

<p>This function is to mark the all elements of an array,
but it slightly differs from the previous mark functions.
Until now, each place to be marked is where we know it surely holds a <code>VALUE</code>
(a pointer to an object).
However this time, where it attempts to mark is the register space,
it is enough to expect that there&#8217;re also what are not <code>VALUE</code>.
To counter that, it tries to detect whether or not the value is a <code>VALUE</code> (a
pointer), then if it seems, the value will be handled as a pointer.
This kind of methods are called &#8220;conservative GC&#8221;.
It seems that it is conservative because it &#8220;tentatively inclines things to the safe side&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll look at the function to check if &#8220;it looks like a <code>VALUE</code>&#8221;,
it is <code>is_pointer_to_heap()</code>.</p>

<p>If I briefly explain it, it would look like the followings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>check if it is in between the top and the bottom of the addresses where <code>RVALUE</code>s reside.</li>
	<li>check if it is in the range of a heap</li>
	<li>make sure the value points to the head of a <code>RVALUE</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the mechanism is like this, it&#8217;s obviously possible that a non-<code>VALUE</code>
value is mistakenly handled as a <code>VALUE</code>.
But at least, it will never fail to find out the used <code>VALUE</code>s.
And, with this amount of tests, it may rarely pick up a non-<code>VALUE</code> value
unless it intentionally does.
Therefore, considering about the benefits we can obtain by GC, it&#8217;s sufficient
to compromise.</p>
<h4>Register Window</h4>
<p>This section is about <code>FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS()</code> which has been deferred.</p>
<p>Register windows are the mechanism to enable to put a part of the machine stack
into inside the <span class="caps">CPU</span>.
In short, it is a cache whose purpose of use is narrowed down.
Recently, it exists only in Sparc architecture.
It&#8217;s possible that there are also <code>VALUE</code>s in register windows,
and it&#8217;s also necessary to get down them into memory.</p>
<p>The content of the macro is like this:</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 125  #if defined(sparc) || defined(__sparc__)
 126  # if defined(linux) || defined(__linux__)
 127  #define FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS  asm("ta  0x83")
 128  # else /* Solaris, not sparc linux */
 129  #define FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS  asm("ta  0x03")
 130  # endif
 131  #else /* Not a sparc */
 132  #define FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS
 133  #endif

(defines.h)
</pre>
<p><code>asm(...)</code> is a built-in assembler.
However, even though I call it assembler, this instruction named <code>ta</code> is the
call of a privileged instruction.
In other words, the call is not of the <span class="caps">CPU</span> but of the OS.
That&#8217;s why the instruction is different for each OS.
The comments describe only about Linux and Solaris,
but actually FreeBSD and NetBSD are also works on Sparc, so this comment is wrong.</p>
<p>Plus, if it is not Sparc, it is unnecessary to flush,
thus <code>FLUSH_REGISTER_WINDOWS</code> is defined as nothing.
Like this, the method to get a macro back to nothing is very famous technique
that is also convenient when debugging.</p>
<h3>Machine Stack</h3>
<p>Then, let&#8217;s go back to the rest of <code>rb_gc()</code>.
This time, it marks <code>VALUES</code>s in the machine stack.</p>

<p><code>rb_gc_stack_start</code> seems the start address (the end of the stack) and

And, <code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code> practically marks the stack space.</p>
<p>There are <code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code> two times in order to deal with the
architectures which are not 4-byte alignment.
<code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code> tries to mark for each portion of <code>sizeof(VALUE)</code>, so
if it is in 2-byte alignment environment, sometimes not be able to properly mark.
In this case, it moves the range 2 bytes then marks again.</p>
<p>Now, <code>rb_gc_stack_start</code>, <code>STACK_END</code>, <code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code>,
let&#8217;s examine these three in this order.</p>

<p>What is important is only the part in the middle.
It defines an arbitrary local variable (it is allocated on the stack) and
it sets its address to <code>rb_gc_stack_start</code>.
The <code>_SEND</code> inside the code for <code>__human68k__</code> is probably the variable defined
by a library of compiler or system.
Naturally, you can presume that it is the contraction of <code>Stack END</code>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the code after that bundled by <code>HAVE_GETRLIMIT</code> appears to check the
length of the stack and do mysterious things.
This is also in the same context of what is done at <code>rb_gc_mark_children()</code> to
prevent the stack overflow.
We can ignore this.</p>
<h4><code>STACK_END</code></h4>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll look at the <code>STACK_END</code> which is the macro to detect the end of the stack.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>STACK_END</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 345  #ifdef C_ALLOCA
 346  # define SET_STACK_END VALUE stack_end; alloca(0);
 347  # define STACK_END (&amp;stack_end)
 348  #else
 349  # if defined(__GNUC__) &amp;&amp; defined(USE_BUILTIN_FRAME_ADDRESS)
 350  #  define SET_STACK_END  VALUE *stack_end = __builtin_frame_address(0)
 351  # else
 352  #  define SET_STACK_END  VALUE *stack_end = alloca(1)
 353  # endif
 354  # define STACK_END (stack_end)
 355  #endif

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p>As there are three variations of <code>SET_STACK_END</code>, let&#8217;s start with the bottom one.
<code>alloca()</code> allocates a space at the end of the stack and returns it,
so the return value and the end address of the stack should be very close.
Hence, it considers the return value of <code>alloca()</code> as an approximate value of
the end of the stack.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back and look at the one at the top. When the macro <code>C_ALLOCA</code> is
defined, <code>alloca()</code> is not natively defined, &#8230; in other words, it indicates a
compatible function is defined in C. I mentioned that in this case <code>alloca()</code>
internally allocates memory by using <code>malloc()</code>.
However, it does not help to get the position of the stack at all.
To deal with this situation, it determines that the local variable <code>stack_end</code>
of the currently executing function is close to the end of the stack and uses
its address (<code>&amp;stack_end</code>).</p>
<p>Plus, this code contains <code>alloca(0)</code> whose purpose is not easy to see.
This has been a feature of the <code>alloca()</code> defined in C since early times,
and it means &#8220;please check and free the unused space&#8221;.
Since this is used when doing GC,
it attempts to free the memory allocated with <code>alloca()</code> at the same time.
But I think it&#8217;s better to put it in another macro instead of mixing into such
place &#8230;</p>
<p>And at last, in the middle case, it is about <code>__builtin_frame_address()</code>.
<code>__GNUC__</code> is a symbol defined in <code>gcc</code> (the compiler of <span class="caps">GNU</span> C).
Since this is used to limit, it is a built-in instruction of <code>gcc</code>.
You can get the address of the n-times previous stack frame with <code>__builtin_frame_address(n)</code>.
As for <code>__builtin_frame_adress(0)</code>, it provides the address of the current frame.</p>
<h4><code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code></h4>
<p>The last one is the <code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code> function that actually marks the stack.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>rb_gc_mark_locations()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 513  void
 514  rb_gc_mark_locations(start, end)
 515      VALUE *start, *end;
 516  {
 517      VALUE *tmp;
 518      long n;
 519
 520      if (start &gt; end) {
 521          tmp = start;
 522          start = end;
 523          end = tmp;
 524      }
 525      n = end - start + 1;
 526      mark_locations_array(start,n);
 527  }

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p>Basically, delegating to the function <code>mark_locations_array()</code> which marks a
space is sufficient.
What this function does is properly adjusting the arguments.
Such adjustment is required because in which direction the machine stack
extends is undecided.
If the machine stack extends to lower addresses, <code>end</code> is smaller,
if it extends to higher addresses, <code>start</code> is smaller.
Therefore, so that the smaller one becomes <code>start</code>, they are adjusted here.</p>
<h3>The other root objects</h3>
<p>Finally, it marks the built-in <code>VALUE</code> containers of the interpretor.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ The other roots</p>

<pre class="longlist">
1159      /* mark the registered global variables */
1160      for (list = global_List; list; list = list-&gt;next) {

1172      rb_gc_mark_parser();

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p>When putting a <code>VALUE</code> into a global variable of C,
it is required to register its address by user via <code>rb_gc_register_address()</code>.
As these objects are saved in <code>global_List</code>, all of them are marked.</p>
<p><code>rb_mark_end_proc()</code> is to mark the procedural objects which are registered via
kind of <code>END</code> statement of Ruby and executed when a program finishes. (<code>END</code>
statements will not be described in this book).</p>
<p><code>rb_gc_mark_global_tbl()</code> is to mark the global variable table <code>rb_global_tbl</code>.
(See also the next chapter &#8220;Variables and Constants&#8221;)</p>
<p><code>rb_mark_tbl(rb_class_tbl)</code> is to mark <code>rb_class_tbl</code> which was discussed in the
previous chapter.</p>
<p><code>rb_gc_mark_trap_list()</code> is to mark the procedural objects which are registered
via the Ruby&#8217;s function-like method <code>trap</code>.
(This is related to signals and will also not be described in this book.)</p>
<p><code>rb_mark_generic_ivar_tbl()</code> is to mark the instance variable table prepared
for non-pointer <code>VALUE</code> such as <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><code>rb_gc_mark_parser()</code> is to mark the semantic stack of the parser.
(The semantic stack will be described in Part 2.)</p>
<p>Until here, the mark phase has been finished.</p>
<h2>Sweep</h2>
<h3>The special treatment for <code>NODE</code></h3>
<p>The sweep phase is the procedures to find out and free the not-marked objects.
But, for some reason, the objects of type <code>T_NODE</code> are specially treated.
Take a look at the next part:</p>
<p class="caption">▼ at the beggining of <code>gc_sweep()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 846  static void
 847  gc_sweep()
 848  {
 849      RVALUE *p, *pend, *final_list;
 850      int freed = 0;
 851      int i, used = heaps_used;
 852
 853      if (ruby_in_compile &amp;&amp; ruby_parser_stack_on_heap()) {
 854          /* If the yacc stack is not on the machine stack,
 855             do not collect NODE while parsing */
 856          for (i = 0; i &lt; used; i++) {
 857              p = heaps[i]; pend = p + heaps_limits[i];
 858              while (p &lt; pend) {
 859                  if (!(p-&gt;as.basic.flags &amp; FL_MARK) &amp;&amp;
                                          BUILTIN_TYPE(p) == T_NODE)
 860                      rb_gc_mark((VALUE)p);
 861                  p++;
 862              }
 863          }
 864      }

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p><code>NODE</code> is a object to express a program in the parser.
<code>NODE</code> is put on the stack prepared by a tool named <code>yacc</code> while compiling,
but that stack is not always on the machine stack.
Concretely speaking, when <code>ruby_parser_stack_on_heap()</code> is false, it indicates
it is not on the machine stack.
In this case, a <code>NODE</code> could be accidentally collected in the middle of its
creation, thus the objects of type <code>T_NODE</code> are unconditionally marked and
protected from being collected while compiling (<code>ruby_in_compile</code>) .</p>
<h3>Finalizer</h3>
<p>After it has reached here, all not-marked objects can be freed.
However, there&#8217;s one thing to do before freeing.
In Ruby the freeing of objects can be hooked, and it is necessary to call them.
This hook is called &#8220;finalizer&#8221;.</p>

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p>This checks all over the object heap from the edge,
and frees the object on which <code>FL_MARK</code> flag is not set by using <code>obj_free()</code> (A).
<code>obj_free()</code> frees, for instance, only <code>char[]</code> used by String objects or
<code>VALUE[]</code> used by Array objects,
but it does not free the <code>RVALUE</code> struct and does not touch <code>basic.flags</code> at all.
Therefore, if a struct is manipulated after <code>obj_free()</code> is called,
there&#8217;s no worry about going down.</p>
<p>After it frees the objects, it branches based on <code>FL_FINALIZE</code> flag (B).
If <code>FL_FINALIZE</code> is set on an object,
since it means at least a finalizer is defined on the object,
the object is added to <code>final_list</code>.
Otherwise, the object is immediately added to <code>freelist</code>.
When finalizing, <code>basic.flags</code> becomes <code>FL_MARK</code>.
The struct-type flag (such as <code>T_STRING</code>) is cleared because of this, and
the object can be distinguished from alive objects.</p>
<p>Then, this phase completes by executing the all finalizers.
Notice that the hooked objects have already died when calling the finalizers.
It means that while executing the finalizers, one cannot use the hooked objects.</p>

<h3><code>rb_gc_force_recycle()</code></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll talk about a little different thing at the end.
Until now, the <code>ruby</code>&#8216;s garbage collector decides whether or not it collects each object,
but there&#8217;s also a way that users explicitly let it collect a particular object.
It&#8217;s <code>rb_gc_force_recycle()</code>.</p>

<p>Its mechanism is not so special, but I introduced this because you&#8217;ll see it
several times in Part 2 and Part 3.</p>
<h2>Discussions</h2>
<h3>To free spaces</h3>
<p>The space allocated by an individual object, say, <code>char[]</code> of <code>String</code>, is
freed during the sweep phase,
but the code to free the <code>RVALUE</code> struct itself has not appeared yet.
And, the object heap also does not manage the number of structs in use and such.
This means that if the <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s object space is once allocated it would never be freed.</p>
<p>For example, the mailer what I&#8217;m creating now temporarily uses the space almost
40M bytes when constructing the threads for 500 mails, but if most of the space
becomes unused as the consequence of GC it will keep occupying the 40M bytes.
Because my machine is also kind of modern,
it does not matter if just the 40M bytes are used.
But, if this occurs in a server which keeps running, there&#8217;s the possibility of
becoming a problem.</p>
<p>However, one also need to consider that <code>free()</code> does not always mean the
decrease of the amount of memory in use.
If it does not return memory to OS, the amount of memory in use of the process
never decrease. And, depending on the implementation of <code>malloc()</code>,
although doing <code>free()</code> it often does not cause returning memory to OS.</p>
<p>&#8230; I had written so, but just before the deadline of this book, <code>RVALUE</code> became to be freed.
The attached CD-<span class="caps">ROM</span> also contains the edge <code>ruby</code>, so please check by <code>diff</code>.
&#8230; what a sad ending.</p>
<h3>Generational GC</h3>
<p>Mark &amp; Sweep has an weak point, it is &#8220;it needs to touch the entire object space
at least once&#8221;. There&#8217;s the possibility that using the idea of Generational GC
can make up for the weak point.</p>
<p>The fundamental of Generational GC is the experiential rule that
&#8220;Most objects are lasting for either very long or very short time&#8221;.
You may be convinced about this point by thinking for seconds about the
programs you write.</p>
<p>Then, thinking based on this rule, one may come up with the idea that
&#8220;long-lived objects do not need to be marked or swept each and every time&#8221;.
Once an object is thought that it will be long-lived,
it is treated specially and excluded from the GC target.
Then, for both marking and sweeping, it can significantly decrease the number
of target objects.
For example, if half of the objects are long-lived at a particular GC time,
the number of the target objects is half.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a problem, though. Generational GC is very difficult to do if objects can&#8217;t be moved.
It is because the long-lived objects are, as I just wrote, needed to &#8220;be treated specially&#8221;.
Since generational GC decreases the number of the objects dealt with and reduces the cost,
if which generation a object belongs to is not clearly categorized,
as a consequence it is equivalent to dealing with both generations.
Furthermore, the <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s GC is also a conservative GC,
so it also has to be created so that <code>is_pointer_to_heap()</code> work.
This is particularly difficult.</p>
<p>How to solve this problem is &#8230; By the hand of Mr. Kiyama Masato,
the implementation of Generational GC for <code>ruby</code> has been published.
I&#8217;ll briefly describe how this patch deals with each problem.
And this time, by courtesy of Mr. Kiyama, this Generational GC patch and its
paper are contained in attached CD-<span class="caps">ROM</span>.
(See also <code>doc/generational-gc.html</code>)</p>
<p>Then, I shall start the explanation.
In order to ease explaining, from now on,
the long-lived objects are called as &#8220;old-generation objects&#8221;,
the short-lived objects are called as &#8220;new-generation objects&#8221;,</p>
<p>First, about the biggest problem which is the special treatment for the old-generation objects.
This point is resolved by linking only the new-generation objects into a list named <code>newlist</code>.
This list is substantialized by increasing <code>RVALUE</code>&#8217;s elements.</p>
<p>Second, about the way to detect the old-generation objects. It is very simply
done by just removing the <code>newlist</code> objects which were not garbage collected
from the <code>newlist</code>.
In other words, once an object survives through GC, it will be treated as an
old-generation object.</p>
<p>Third, about the way to detect the references from old-generation objects to new-generation objects.
In Generational GC, it&#8217;s sort of, the old-generation objects keep being in the marked state.
However, when there are links from old-generation to new-generation,
the new-generation objects will not be marked. (Figure 11)</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_gengc.jpg" alt="(gengc)"><br>
Figure 11: reference over generations</p>
<ul>
	<li>ルートオブジェクト the root objects</li>
	<li>新世代 new-generation</li>
	<li>旧世代 old-generation
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not good, so at the moment when an old-generational object refers to a new-generational object,
the new-generational object must be turned into old-generational.
The patch modifies the libraries and
adds checks to where there&#8217;s possibility that this kind of references happens.</p>
<p>This is the outline of its mechanism. It was scheduled that this patch is included <code>ruby</code> 1.7,
but it has not been included yet. It is said that the reason is its speed,
There&#8217;s an inference that the cost of the third point &#8220;check all references&#8221; matters,
but the precise cause has not figured out.</p>
<h3>Compaction</h3>
<p>Could the <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s GC do compaction?
Since <code>VALUE</code> of <code>ruby</code> is a direct pointer to a struct,
if the address of the struct are changed because of compaction,
it is necessary to change the all <code>VALUE</code>s that point to the moved structs.</p>
<p>However, since the <code>ruby</code>&#8217;s GC is a conservative GC, &#8220;the case when it is
impossible to determine whether or not it is really a <code>VALUE</code>&#8221; is possible.
Changing the value even though in this situation,
if it was not <code>VALUE</code> something awful will happen.
Compaction and conservative GC are really incompatible.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s contrive countermeasures in one way or another.
The first way is to let <code>VALUE</code> be an object ID instead of a pointer. (Figure 12)
It means sandwiching a indirect layer between <code>VALUE</code> and a struct.
In this way, as it&#8217;s not necessary to rewrite <code>VALUE</code>, structs can be safely moved.
But as trade-offs, accessing speed slows down and the compatibility of
extension libraries is lost.</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_objid.jpg" alt="(objid)"><br>
Figure 12: reference through the object ID</p>
<ul>
	<li>アドレスを入れる store addresses</li>
	<li>インデックスを入れる store indexes</li>
	<li>移動できる can be moved
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, the next way is to allow moving the struct only when they are pointed
from only the pointers that &#8220;is surely <code>VALUE</code>&#8221; (Figure 13).
This method is called Mostly-copying garbage collection.
In the ordinary programs, there are not so many objects that
<code>is_pointer_to_heap()</code> is true, so the probability of being able to move the
object structs is quite high.</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_gc_mostcopy.jpg" alt="(mostcopy)"><br>
Figure 13: Mostly-copying garbage collection</p>
<ul>
	<li>(above) Since there&#8217;s a possibility of being referred to by non-<span class="caps">VALUE</span>,
  this object is not moved.</li>
	<li>(bottom) Since it is sure that this is referred only VALUEs,
  this object can be moved.</li>
	<li>移動 move
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover and moreover, by enabling to move the struct,
the implementation of Generational GC becomes simple at the same time.
It seems to be worth to challenge.</p>
<h3><code>volatile</code> to protect from GC</h3>
<p>I wrote that GC takes care of <code>VALUE</code> on the stack,
therefore if a <code>VALUE</code> is located as a local variable the <code>VALUE</code> should certainly be marked.
But in reality due to the effects of optimization, it&#8217;s possible that the
variables disappear.
For example, there&#8217;s a possibility of disappearing in the following case:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
VALUE str;
str = rb_str_new2("...");
printf("%s\n", RSTRING(str)-&gt;ptr);
</pre>
<p>Because this code does not access the <code>str</code> itself,
some compilers only keeps <code>str-&gt;ptr</code> in memory and deletes the <code>str</code>.
If this happened, the <code>str</code> would be collected and the process would be down.
There&#8217;s no choice in this case</p>
<pre class="emlist">
volatile VALUE str;
</pre>
<p>we need to write this way. <code>volatile</code> is a reserved word of C,
and it has an effect of forbidding optimizations that have to do with this variable.
If <code>volatile</code> was attached in the code relates to Ruby,
you could assume almost certainly that its exists for GC.
When I read K &amp; R, I thought &#8220;what is the use of this?&#8221;,
and totally didn&#8217;t expect to see the plenty of them in <code>ruby</code>.</p>
<p>Considering these aspects, the promise of the conservative GC &#8220;users don&#8217;t have
to care about GC&#8221; seems  not always true. There was once a discussion that &#8220;the
Scheme&#8217;s GC named <span class="caps">KSM</span> does not need <code>volatile</code>&#8221;,
but it seems it could not be applied to <code>ruby</code> because its algorithm has a hole.</p>
<h2>When to invoke</h2>
<h3>Inside <code>gc.c</code></h3>
<p>When to invoke GC?
Inside <code>gc.c</code>, there are three places calling <code>rb_gc()</code>
inside of <code>gc.c</code>,</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>ruby_xmalloc()</code></li>
	<li><code>ruby_xrealloc()</code></li>
	<li><code>rb_newobj()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As for <code>ruby_xmalloc()</code> and <code>ruby_xrealloc()</code>, it is when failing to allocate memory.
Doing GC may free memories and it&#8217;s possible that a space becomes available again.
<code>rb_newobj()</code> has a similar situation, it invokes when <code>freelist</code> becomes empty.</p>
<h3>Inside the interpritor</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s several places except for <code>gc.c</code> where calling <code>rb_gc()</code> in the interpretor.</p>
<p>First, in <code>io.c</code> and <code>dir.c</code>, when it runs out of file descriptors and could not open,
it invokes GC. If <code>IO</code> objects are garbage collected, it&#8217;s possible that the
files are closed and file descriptors become available.</p>
<p>In <code>ruby.c</code>, <code>rb_gc()</code> is sometimes done after loading a file.
As I mentioned in the previous Sweep section, it is to compensate for the fact
that <code>NODE</code> cannot be garbage collected while compiling.</p>
<h2>Object Creation</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve finished about GC and come to be able to deal with the Ruby objects from
its creation to its freeing.
So I&#8217;d like to describe about object creations here.
This is not so related to GC, rather, it is related a little to the discussion
about classes in the previous chapter.</p>
<h3>Allocation Framework</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve created objects many times. For example, in this way:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
class C
end
C.new()
</pre>
<p>At this time, how does <code>C.new</code> create a object?</p>
<p>First, <code>C.new</code> is actually <code>Class#new</code>. Its actual body is this:</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>rb_class_new_instance()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 725  VALUE
 726  rb_class_new_instance(argc, argv, klass)
 727      int argc;
 728      VALUE *argv;
 729      VALUE klass;
 730  {
 731      VALUE obj;
 732
 733      obj = rb_obj_alloc(klass);
 734      rb_obj_call_init(obj, argc, argv);
 735
 736      return obj;
 737  }

(object.c)
</pre>
<p><code>rb_obj_alloc()</code> calles the <code>allocate</code> method against the <code>klass</code>.
In other words, it calls <code>C.allocate</code> in this example currently explained.
It is <code>Class#allocate</code> by default and its actual body is <code>rb_class_allocate_instance()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>rb_class_allocate_instance()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 708  static VALUE
 709  rb_class_allocate_instance(klass)
 710      VALUE klass;
 711  {
 712      if (FL_TEST(klass, FL_SINGLETON)) {
 713          rb_raise(rb_eTypeError,
                       "can't create instance of virtual class");
 714      }
 715      if (rb_frame_last_func() != alloc) {
 716          return rb_obj_alloc(klass);
 717      }
 718      else {
 719          NEWOBJ(obj, struct RObject);
 720          OBJSETUP(obj, klass, T_OBJECT);
 721          return (VALUE)obj;
 722      }
 723  }

(object.c)
</pre>
<p><code>rb_newobj()</code> is a function that returns a <code>RVALUE</code> by taking from the <code>freelist</code>.
<code>NEWOBJ()</code> is just a <code>rb_newobj()</code> with type-casting.
The <code>OBJSETUP()</code> is a macro to initialize the <code>struct RBasic</code> part,
you can think that this exists only in order not to forget to set the <code>FL_TAINT</code> flag.</p>
<p>The rest is going back to <code>rb_class_new_instance()</code>, then it calls <code>rb_obj_call_init()</code>.
This function calls <code>initialize</code> on the just created object,
and the initialization completes.</p>
<p>This is summarized as follows:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
SomeClass.new            = Class#new (rb_class_new_instance)
    SomeClass.allocate       = Class#allocate (rb_class_allocate_instance)
    SomeClass#initialize     = Object#initialize (rb_obj_dummy)
</pre>
<p>I could say that the <code>allocate</code> class method is to physically initialize,
the <code>initialize</code> is to logically initialize.
The mechanism like this, in other words the mechanism that an object creation
is divided into <code>allocate</code> / <code>initialize</code> and <code>new</code> presides them, is called
the &#8220;allocation framework&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Creating User Defined Objects</h3>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll examine about the instance creations of the classes defined in
extension libraries.
As it is called user-defined, its struct is not decided, without telling
how to allocate it, <code>ruby</code> don&#8217;t understand how to create its object.
Let&#8217;s look at how to tell it.</p>
<h4><code>Data_Wrap_Struct()</code></h4>
<p>Whichever it is user-defined or not, its creation mechanism itself can follow
the allocation framework.
It means that when defining a new <code>SomeClass</code> class in C,
we overwrite both <code>SomeClass.allocate</code> and <code>SomeClass#initialize</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the <code>allocate</code> side first. Here, it does the physical initialization.
What is necessary to allocate?
I mentioned that the instance of the user-defined class is a pair of
<code>struct RData</code> and a user-prepared struct.
We&#8217;ll assume that the struct is of type <code>struct my</code>.
In order to create a <code>VALUE</code> based on the <code>struct my</code>, you can use <code>Data_Wrap_Struct()</code>.
This is how to use:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
struct my *ptr = malloc(sizeof(struct my));  /* arbitrarily allocate in the heap */
VALUE val = Data_Wrap_Struct(data_class, mark_f, free_f, ptr);
</pre>
<p><code>data_class</code> is the class that <code>val</code> belongs to, <code>ptr</code> is the pointer to be wrapped.
<code>mark_f</code> is (the pointer to) the function to mark this struct.
However, this does not mark the <code>ptr</code> itself and is used when the struct
pointed by <code>ptr</code> contains <code>VALUE</code>.
On the other hand, <code>free_f</code> is the function to free the <code>ptr</code> itself.
The argument of the both functions is <code>ptr</code>.
Going back a little and reading the code to mark may help you to understand
things around here in one shot.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s also look at the content of <code>Data_Wrap_Struct()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>Data_Wrap_Struct()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 369  #define Data_Wrap_Struct(klass, mark, free, sval) \
 370      rb_data_object_alloc(klass, sval,             \
                               (RUBY_DATA_FUNC)mark,    \
                               (RUBY_DATA_FUNC)free)

 365  typedef void (*RUBY_DATA_FUNC) _((void*));

(ruby.h)
</pre>
<p>Most of it is delegated to <code>rb_object_alloc()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>rb_data_object_alloc()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 310  VALUE
 311  rb_data_object_alloc(klass, datap, dmark, dfree)
 312      VALUE klass;
 313      void *datap;
 314      RUBY_DATA_FUNC dmark;
 315      RUBY_DATA_FUNC dfree;
 316  {
 317      NEWOBJ(data, struct RData);
 318      OBJSETUP(data, klass, T_DATA);
 319      data-&gt;data = datap;
 320      data-&gt;dfree = dfree;
 321      data-&gt;dmark = dmark;
 322
 323      return (VALUE)data;
 324  }

(gc.c)
</pre>
<p>This is not complicated. As the same as the ordinary objects, it prepares a
<code>RVALUE</code> by using <code>NEWOBJ() OBJSETUP()</code>,
and sets the members.</p>
<p>Here, let&#8217;s go back to <code>allocate</code>.
We&#8217;ve succeeded to create a <code>VALUE</code> by now,
so the rest is putting it in an arbitrary function
and defining the function on a class by <code>rb_define_singleton_method()</code>.</p>
<h4><code>Data_Get_Struct()</code></h4>
<p>The next thing is <code>initialize</code>. Not only for <code>initialize</code>, the methods need a
way to pull out the <code>struct my*</code> from the previously created <code>VALUE</code>. In order
to do it, you can use the <code>Data_Get_Struct()</code> macro.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>Data_Get_Struct()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
 378  #define Data_Get_Struct(obj,type,sval) do {\
 379      Check_Type(obj, T_DATA); \
 380      sval = (type*)DATA_PTR(obj);\
 381  } while (0)

 360  #define DATA_PTR(dta) (RDATA(dta)-&gt;data)

(ruby.h)
</pre>
<p>As you see, it just takes the pointer (to <code>struct my</code>) from a member of <code>RData</code>.
This is simple. <code>Check_Type()</code> just checks the struct type.</p>
<h3>The Issues of the Allocation Framework</h3>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve explained innocently until now, but actually the current allocation
framework has a fatal issue.
I just described that the object created with <code>allocate</code> appears to the
<code>initialize</code> or the other methods, but if the passed object that was created
with <code>allocate</code> is not of the same class, it must be a very serious problem.
For example, if the object created with the default <code>Objct.allocate</code>
(<code>Class#allocate</code>) is passed to the method of <code>String</code>, this cause a serious problem.
That is because even though the methods of <code>String</code> are written
based on the assumption that a struct of type <code>struct RString</code> is given,
the given object is actually a <code>struct RObject</code>.
In order to avoid such situation,
the object created with <code>C.allocate</code> must be passed only to the methods of <code>C</code>
or its subclasses.</p>
<p>Of course, this is always true when things are ordinarily done.
As <code>C.allocate</code> creates the instance of the class <code>C</code>,
it is not passed to the methods of the other classes.
As an exception, it is possible that it is passed to the method of <code>Object</code>,
but the methods of <code>Object</code> does not depend on the struct type.</p>
<p>However, what if it is not ordinarily done?
Since <code>C.allocate</code> is exposed at the Ruby level,
though I&#8217;ve not described about them yet,
by making use of <code>alias</code> or <code>super</code> or something,
the definition of <code>allocate</code> can be moved to another class.
In this way, you can create an object whose class is <code>String</code> but whose actual
struct type is <code>struct RObject</code>.
It means that you can freely let <code>ruby</code> down from the Ruby level.
This is a problem.</p>
<p>The source of the issue is that <code>allocate</code> is exposed to the Ruby level as a method.
Conversely speaking, a solution is to define the content of <code>allocate</code> on the
class by using a way that is anything but a method.
So,</p>
<pre class="emlist">
rb_define_allocator(rb_cMy, my_allocate);
</pre>
<p>an alternative like this is currently in discussion.</p>
