Chapter 14: Context
===================


The range covered by this chapter is really broad. First of all, I'll describe
about how the internal state of the evaluator is expressed. After that, as
an actual example, we'll read how the state is changed on a class definition
statement. Subsequently, we'll examine how the internal state influences method
definition statements. Lastly, we'll observe how the both statements change the
behaviors of the variable definitions and the variable references.




The Ruby stack
--------------


### Context and Stack


With an image of a typical procedural language, each time calling a procedure,
the information which is necessary to execute the procedure such as the local
variable space and the place to return is stored in a struct (a stack frame)
and it is pushed on the stack.
When returning from a procedure, the struct which is on the top of the stack
is popped and the state is returned to the previous method.
The executing image of a C program which was explained at Chapter 5: Garbage collection
is a perfect example.


What to be careful about here is, what is changing during the execution is only
the stack, on the contrary, the program remains unchanged wherever it is.
For example, if it is "a reference to the local variable `i`", there's just an
order of "give me `i` of the current frame", it is not written as "give me `i`
of that frame". In other words, "only" the state of the stack influences the
consequence. This is why,
even if a procedure is called anytime and any number of times,
we only have to write its code once (Fig. 1).

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_stack.jpg" alt="figure 1: What is changing is only the stack">
  <figcaption>figure 1: What is changing is only the stack</figcaption>
</figure>


The execution of Ruby is also basically nothing but chained calls of methods
which are procedures, so essentially it has the same image as above.
In other words, with the same code, things being accessed such as local
variable scope and the block local scope will be changing.
And these kind of scopes are expressed by stacks.


However in Ruby, for instance, you can temporarily go back to the scope
previously used by using iterators or `Proc`.
This cannot be implemented with just simply pushing/popping a stack.
Therefore the frames of the Ruby stack will be intricately rearranged during
execution. Although I call it "stack", it could be better to consider it
as a list.


Other than the method call, the local variable scope can also be changed on the
class definitions. So, the method calls does not match the transitions of the
local variable scope. Since there are also blocks, it's necessary to handle them
separately. For these various reasons, surprisingly, there are seven stacks.



| Stack Pointer | Stack Frame Type     | Description                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ruby_frame`  | `struct FRAME`       | the records of method calls                       |
| `ruby_scope`  | `struct SCOPE`       | the local variable scope                          |
| `ruby_block`  | `struct BLOCK`       | the block scope                                   |
| `ruby_iter`   | `struct iter`        | whether or not the current `FRAME` is an iterator |
| `ruby_class`  | `VALUE`              | the class to define methods on                    |
| `ruby_cref`   | `NODE` (`NODE_CREF`) | the class nesting information                     |


C has only one stack and Ruby has seven stacks, by simple arithmetic, the
executing image of Ruby is at least seven times more complicated than C.
But it is actually not seven times at all,
it's at least twenty times more complicated.


First, I'll briefly describe about these stacks and their stack frame structs.
The defined file is either `eval.c` or `evn.h`. Basically these stack frames
are touched only by `eval.c` ... is what it should be if it were possible,
but `gc.c` needs to know the struct types when marking,
so some of them are exposed in `env.h`.


Of course, marking could be done in the other file but `gc.c`, but it requires
separated functions which cause slowing down. The ordinary programs had better
not care about such things, but both the garbage collector and the core of the
evaluator is the ruby's biggest bottleneck, so it's quite worth to optimize
even for just one method call.




### `ruby_frame`


`ruby_frame` is a stack to record method calls. The stack frame struct is
`struct FRAME`. This terminology is a bit confusing but please be aware that
I'll distinctively write it just a frame when it means a "stack frame" as a
general noun and `FRAME` when it means `struct FRAME`.


<p class="caption">▼ `ruby_frame` </p>

```c
  16  extern struct FRAME {
  17      VALUE self;          /* self */
  18      int argc;            /* the argument count */
  19      VALUE *argv;         /* the array of argument values */
  20      ID last_func;        /* the name of this FRAME (when called) */
  21      ID orig_func;        /* the name of this FRAME (when defined) */
  22      VALUE last_class;    /* the class of last_func's receiver */
  23      VALUE cbase;         /* the base point for searching constants and class variables */
  24      struct FRAME *prev;
  25      struct FRAME *tmp;   /* to protect from GC. this will be described later */
  26      struct RNode *node;  /* the file name and the line number of the currently executed line. */
  27      int iter;            /* is this called with a block? */
  28      int flags;           /* the below two */
  29  } *ruby_frame;

  33  #define FRAME_ALLOCA 0   /* FRAME is allocated on the machine stack */
  34  #define FRAME_MALLOC 1   /* FRAME is allocated by malloc */

(env.h)
```


First af all, since there's the `prev` member, you can infer that the stack is
made of a linked list. (Fig.2)

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_framestack.jpg" alt="figure 2: `ruby_frame`">
  <figcaption>figure 2: <code class="inline">ruby_frame</code></figcaption>
</figure>


The fact that `ruby_xxxx` points to the top stack frame is common to all stacks
and won't be mentioned every time.


The first member of the struct is `self`.
There is also `self` in the arguments of `rb_eval()`,
but why this struct remembers another `self` ?
This is for the C-level functions. More precisely, it's for `rb_call_super()` that is
corresponding to `super`. In order to execute `super`, it requires the receiver
of the current method, but the caller side of `rb_call_super()` could not have
such information. However, the chain of `rb_eval()` is interrupted before the
time when the execution of the user-defined C code starts. Therefore, the
conclusion is that there need a way to obtain the information of `self` out of
nothing. And, `FRAME` is the right place to store it.


Thinking a little further, It's mysterious that there are `argc` and `argv`.
Because parameter variables are local variables after all, it is unnecessary to
preserve the given arguments after assigning them into the local variable with
the same names at the beginning of the method, isn't it?
Then, what is the use of them ? The answer is that this is actually for
`super` again. In Ruby, when calling `super` without any arguments, the values of
the parameter variables of the method will be passed to the method of the
superclass.
Thus, (the local variable space for) the parameter variables must be reserved.


Additionally, the difference between `last_func` and `orig_func` will come
out in the cases like when the method is `alias` ed.
For instance,



```ruby
class C
  def orig() end
  alias ali orig
end
C.new.ali
```


in this case, `last_func=ali` and `orig_func=orig`.
Not surprisingly, these members also have to do with `super`.




### `ruby_scope`


`ruby_scope` is the stack to represent the local variable scope. The method and
class definition statements, the module definition statements and the singleton
class definition statements, all of them are different scopes. The stack frame
struct is `struct SCOPE`.
I'll call this frame `SCOPE`.


<p class="caption">▼ `ruby_scope` </p>

```c
  36  extern struct SCOPE {
  37      struct RBasic super;
  38      ID *local_tbl;        /* an array of the local variable names */
  39      VALUE *local_vars;    /* the space to store local variables */
  40      int flags;            /* the below four */
  41  } *ruby_scope;

  43  #define SCOPE_ALLOCA  0         /* local_vars is allocated by alloca */
  44  #define SCOPE_MALLOC  1         /* local_vars is allocated by malloc */
  45  #define SCOPE_NOSTACK 2         /* POP_SCOPE is done  */
  46  #define SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE 4    /* Proc is created with this SCOPE */

(env.h)
```


Since the first element is `struct RBasic`, this is a Ruby object. This is in
order to handle `Proc` objects. For example, let's try to think about the case
like this:



```ruby
def make_counter
  lvar = 0
  return Proc.new { lvar += 1 }
end

cnt = make_counter()
p cnt.call    # 1
p cnt.call    # 2
p cnt.call    # 3
cnt = nil  # cut the reference. The created Proc finally becomes unnecessary here.
```


The `Proc` object created by this method will persist longer than the method that
creates it. And, because the `Proc` can refer to the local variable `lvar`,
the local variables must be preserved until the `Proc` will disappear.
Thus, if it were not handled by the garbage collector, no one can determine the
time to free.


There are two reasons why `struct SCOPE` is separated from `struct FRAME`.
Firstly, the things like class definition statements are not method
calls but create distinct local variable scopes.
Secondly, when a called method is defined in C the Ruby's local
variable space is unnecessary.




### `ruby_block`


`struct BLOCK` is the real body of a Ruby's iterator block or a `Proc` object,
it is also kind of a snapshot of the evaluator at some point.
This frame will also be briefly written as `BLOCK` as in the same manner as
`FRAME` and `SCOPE`.


<p class="caption">▼ `ruby_block` </p>

```c
 580  static struct BLOCK *ruby_block;

 559  struct BLOCK {
 560      NODE *var;               /* the block parameters（mlhs） */
 561      NODE *body;              /* the code of the block body */
 562      VALUE self;              /* the self when this BLOCK is created */
 563      struct FRAME frame;      /* the copy of ruby_frame when this BLOCK is created */
 564      struct SCOPE *scope;     /* the ruby_scope when this BLOCK is created */
 565      struct BLOCKTAG *tag;    /* the identity of this BLOCK */
 566      VALUE klass;             /* the ruby_class when this BLOCK is created */
 567      int iter;                /* the ruby_iter when this BLOCK is created */
 568      int vmode;               /* the scope_vmode when this BLOCK is created */
 569      int flags;               /* BLOCK_D_SCOPE, BLOCK_DYNAMIC */
 570      struct RVarmap *dyna_vars;   /* the block local variable space */
 571      VALUE orig_thread;       /* the thread that creates this BLOCK */
 572      VALUE wrapper;           /* the ruby_wrapper when this BLOCK is created */
 573      struct BLOCK *prev;
 574  };

 553  struct BLOCKTAG {
 554      struct RBasic super;
 555      long dst;                /* destination, that is, the place to return */
 556      long flags;              /* BLOCK_DYNAMIC, BLOCK_ORPHAN */
 557  };

 576  #define BLOCK_D_SCOPE 1      /* having distinct block local scope */
 577  #define BLOCK_DYNAMIC 2      /* BLOCK was taken from a Ruby program */
 578  #define BLOCK_ORPHAN  4      /* the FRAME that creates this BLOCK has finished */


(eval.c)
```


Note that `frame` is not a pointer. This is because the entire content of
`struct FRAME` will be all copied and preserved. The entire `struct FRAME` is
(for better performance) allocated on the machine stack, but `BLOCK` could
persist longer than the `FRAME` that creates it, the preservation is a
preparation for that case.


Additionally, `struct BLOCKTAG` is separated in order to detect the same block
when multiple `Proc` objects are created from the block. The `Proc` objects
which were created from the one same block have the same `BLOCKTAG`.




### `ruby_iter`


The stack `ruby_iter` indicates whether currently calling method is an iterator
(whether it is called with a block). The frame is `struct iter`.
But for consistency I'll call it `ITER`.


<p class="caption">▼ `ruby_iter` </p>

```c
 767  static struct iter *ruby_iter;

 763  struct iter {
 764      int iter;           /* the below three */
 765      struct iter *prev;
 766  };

 769  #define ITER_NOT 0      /* the currently evaluated method is not an iterator */
 770  #define ITER_PRE 1      /* the method which is going to be evaluated next is an iterator */
 771  #define ITER_CUR 2      /* the currently evaluated method is an iterator */
(eval.c)
```


Although for each method we can determine whether it is an iterator or not,
there's another struct that is distinct from `struct FRAME`. Why?


It's obvious you need to inform it to the method when "it is an iterator",
but you also need to inform the fact when "it is not an iterator".
However, pushing a whole `BLOCK` just for this is very heavy. It will also
cause that in the caller side the procedures such as variable references
would needlessly increase.
Thus, it's better to push the smaller and lighter `ITER` instead of `BLOCK`.
This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 16: Blocks.




### `ruby_dyna_vars`


The block local variable space. The frame struct is `struct RVarmap` that has
already seen in Part 2. From now on, I'll call it just `VARS`.


<p class="caption">▼ `struct RVarmap`</p>

```c
  52  struct RVarmap {
  53      struct RBasic super;
  54      ID id;                  /* the name  of the variable */
  55      VALUE val;              /* the value of the variable */
  56      struct RVarmap *next;
  57  };

(env.h)
```


Note that a frame is not a single `struct RVarmap` but a list of the structs (Fig.3).
And each frame is corresponding to a local variable scope.
Since it corresponds to "local variable scope" and not "block local variable scope",
for instance, even if blocks are nested, only a single list is used to express.
The break between blocks are similar to the one of the parser,
it is expressed by a `RVarmap` (header) whose `id` is `0`.
Details are deferred again. It will be explained in Chapter 16: Blocks.

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_vars.jpg" alt="figure 3: `ruby_dyna_vars`">
  <figcaption>figure 3: <code class="inline">ruby_dyna_vars</code></figcaption>
</figure>


### `ruby_class`


`ruby_class` represents the current class to which a method is defined. Since
`self` will be that class when it's a normal class definition statement,
`ruby_class == self`. But, when it is the top level or in the middle of
particular methods like `eval` and `instance_eval`, `self != ruby_class` is
possible.


The frame of `ruby_class` is a simple `VALUE` and there's no particular frame
struct. Then, how could it be like a stack? Moreover, there were many structs
without the `prev` pointer, how could these form a stack? The answer is deferred
to the next section.


From now on, I'll call this frame `CLASS`.




### `ruby_cref`


`ruby_cref` represents the information of the nesting of a class.
I'll call this frame `CREF` with the same way of naming as before.
Its struct is ...


<p class="caption">▼ `ruby_cref` </p>

```c
 847  static NODE *ruby_cref = 0;

(eval.c)
```


... surprisingly `NODE`. This is used just as a "defined struct which can be
pointed by a `VALUE`". The node type is `NODE_CREF` and the assignments of its
members are shown below:


| Union Member | Macro To Access | Usage                        |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| u1.value     | nd_clss         | the outer class (`VALUE`)    |
| u2           | -               | -                            |
| u3.node      | nd_next         | preserve the previous `CREF` |


Even though the member name is `nd_next`, the value it actually has is the
"previous (prev)" `CREF`. Taking the following program as an example, I'll
explain the actual appearance.



```ruby
class A
  class B
    class C
      nil   # （A）
    end
  end
end
```


Fig.4 shows how `ruby_cref` is when evaluating the code (A).

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_crefstack.jpg" alt="figure 4: `ruby_cref`">
  <figcaption>figure 4: <code class="inline">ruby_cref</code></figcaption>
</figure>


However, illustrating this image everytime is tedious and its intention becomes unclear.
Therefore, the same state as Fig.4 will be expressed in the following notation:



```
A ← B ← C
```


### `PUSH` / `POP` Macros

For each stack frame struct, the macros to push and pop are available.
For instance, `PUSH_FRAME` and `POP_FRAME` for `FRAME`.
Because these will appear in a moment,
I'll then explain the usage and content.


### The other states


While they are not so important as the main stacks, the evaluator of `ruby` has
the several other states. This is a brief list of them. However, some of them
are not stacks. Actually, most of them are not.


| Variable Name       | Type    | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope_vmode`       | `int`   | the default visibility when a method is defined                     |
| `ruby_in_eval`      | `int`   | whether or not parsing after the evaluation is started              |
| `ruby_current_node` | `NODE*` | the file name and the line number of what currently being evaluated |
| `ruby_safe_level`   | `int`   | `$SAFE`                                                             |
| `ruby_errinfo`      | `VALUE` | the exception currently being handled                               |
| `ruby_wrapper`      | `VALUE` | the wrapper module to isolate the environment                       |






Module Definition
-----------------


The `class` statement and the `module` statement and the singleton class
definition statement, they are all implemented in similar ways.

Because seeing similar things continuously three times is not interesting, this time let's
examine the `module` statement which has the least elements (thus, is simple).


First of all, what is the `module` statement? Conversely, what should happen is
the module `statement` ? Let's try to list up several features:


* a new module object should be created
* the created module should be `self`
* it should have an independent local variable scope
* if you write a constant assignment, a constant should be defined on the module
* if you write a class variable assignment,
  a class variable should be defined on the module.
* if you write a `def` statement, a method should be defined on the module


What is the way to achieve these things? ... is the point of this section.
Now, let's start to look at the codes.




### Investigation

<p class="caption">▼The Source Program</p>

```ruby
module M
  a = 1
end
```


<p class="caption">▼Its Syntax Tree</p>

```
NODE_MODULE
nd_cname = 9621 (M)
nd_body:
    NODE_SCOPE
    nd_rval = (null)
    nd_tbl = 3 [ _ ~ a ]
    nd_next:
        NODE_LASGN
        nd_cnt = 2
        nd_value:
            NODE_LIT
            nd_lit = 1:Fixnum
```


`nd_cname` seems the module name. `cname` is probably either Const NAME or Class
NAME. I dumped several things and found that there's always `NODE_SCOPE` in
`nd_body`. Since its member `nd_tbl` holds a local variable table and its name
is similar to `struct SCOPE`, it appears certain that this `NODE_SCOPE`
plays an important role to create a local variable scope.




### `NODE_MODULE`


Let's examine the handler of `NODE_MODULE` of `rb_eval()`. The parts that are
not close to the main line, such as `ruby_raise()` and error handling were cut
drastically. So far, there have been a lot of cutting works for 200 pages,
it has already became unnecessary to show the original code.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_MODULE` (simplified)</p>

```c
case NODE_MODULE:
  {
      VALUE module;

      if (rb_const_defined_at(ruby_class, node->nd_cname)) {
          /* just obtain the already created module */
          module = rb_const_get(ruby_class, node->nd_cname);
      }
      else {
          /* create a new module and set it into the constant */
          module = rb_define_module_id(node->nd_cname);
          rb_const_set(ruby_cbase, node->nd_cname, module);
          rb_set_class_path(module,ruby_class,rb_id2name(node->nd_cname));
      }

      result = module_setup(module, node->nd_body);
  }
  break;
```


First, we'd like to make sure the module is nested and defined above (the module holded by) `ruby_class`.
We can understand it from the fact that it calls `ruby_const_xxxx()` on `ruby_class`.
Just once `ruby_cbase` appears, but it is usually identical to `ruby_class`,
so we can ignore it. Even if they are different, it rarely causes a problem.



The first half, it is branching by `if` because it needs to check if the
module has already been defined. This is because, in Ruby,
we can do "additional" definitions on the same one module any number of times.



```ruby
module M
  def a    # M#a is deifned
  end
end
module M   # add a definition (not re-defining or overwriting)
  def b    # M#b is defined
  end
end
```


In this program, the two methods, `a` and `b`, will be defined on the module `M`.


In this case, on the second definition of `M` the module `M` was already set to
the constant, just obtaining and using it would be sufficient. If the constant
`M` does not exist yet, it means the first definition and the module is created
(by `rb_define_module_id()` )


Lastly, `module_setup()` is the function executing the body of a module
statement. Not only the module statements but the class statements and the
singleton class statements are executed by `module_setup()`.
This is the reason why I said "all of these three type of statements are
similar things".
For now, I'd like you to note that `node->nd_body` (`NODE_SCOPE`) is passed as
an argument.




### `module_setup`


For the module and class and singleton class statements, `module_setup()`
executes their bodies. Finally, the Ruby stack manipulations will appear in
large amounts.


<p class="caption">▼ `module_setup()` </p>

```c
3424  static VALUE
3425  module_setup(module, n)
3426      VALUE module;
3427      NODE *n;
3428  {
3429      NODE * volatile node = n;
3430      int state;
3431      struct FRAME frame;
3432      VALUE result;               /* OK */
3433      TMP_PROTECT;
3434
3435      frame = *ruby_frame;
3436      frame.tmp = ruby_frame;
3437      ruby_frame = &frame;
3438
3439      PUSH_CLASS();
3440      ruby_class = module;
3441      PUSH_SCOPE();
3442      PUSH_VARS();
3443
          /* （A）ruby_scope->local_vars initialization */
3444      if (node->nd_tbl) {
3445          VALUE *vars = TMP_ALLOC(node->nd_tbl[0]+1);
3446          *vars++ = (VALUE)node;
3447          ruby_scope->local_vars = vars;
3448          rb_mem_clear(ruby_scope->local_vars, node->nd_tbl[0]);
3449          ruby_scope->local_tbl = node->nd_tbl;
3450      }
3451      else {
3452          ruby_scope->local_vars = 0;
3453          ruby_scope->local_tbl  = 0;
3454      }
3455
3456      PUSH_CREF(module);
3457      ruby_frame->cbase = (VALUE)ruby_cref;
3458      PUSH_TAG(PROT_NONE);
3459      if ((state = EXEC_TAG()) == 0) {
3460          if (trace_func) {
3461              call_trace_func("class", ruby_current_node, ruby_class,
3462                              ruby_frame->last_func,
3463                              ruby_frame->last_class);
3464          }
3465          result = rb_eval(ruby_class, node->nd_next);
3466      }
3467      POP_TAG();
3468      POP_CREF();
3469      POP_VARS();
3470      POP_SCOPE();
3471      POP_CLASS();
3472
3473      ruby_frame = frame.tmp;
3474      if (trace_func) {
3475          call_trace_func("end", ruby_last_node, 0,
3476                          ruby_frame->last_func, ruby_frame->last_class);
3477      }
3478      if (state) JUMP_TAG(state);
3479
3480      return result;
3481  }

(eval.c)
```


This is too big to read all in one gulp.
Let's cut the parts that seems unnecessary.


First, the parts around `trace_func` can be deleted unconditionally.


We can see the idioms related to tags. Let's simplify them by expressing with
the Ruby's ensure.


Immediately after the start of the function, the argument n is purposefully
assigned to the local variable `node`, but `volatile` is attached to `node` and
it would never be assigned after that, thus this is to prevent from being
garbage collected. If we assume that the argument was `node` from the beginning,
it would not change the meaning.


In the first half of the function, there's the part manipulating `ruby_frame`
complicatedly. It is obviously paired up with the part `ruby_frame = frame.tmp`
in the last half. We'll focus on this part later, but for the time being this
can be considered as `push pop` of `ruby_frame`.


Plus, it seems that the code (A) can be, as commented, summarized as the
initialization of `ruby_scope->local_vars`. This will be discussed later.


Consequently, it could be summarized as follows:


<p class="caption">▼ `module_setup` (simplified)</p>

```c
static VALUE
module_setup(module, node)
    VALUE module;
    NODE *node;
{
    struct FRAME frame;
    VALUE result;

    push FRAME
    PUSH_CLASS();
    ruby_class = module;
    PUSH_SCOPE();
    PUSH_VARS();
    ruby_scope->local_vars initializaion
    PUSH_CREF(module);
    ruby_frame->cbase = (VALUE)ruby_cref;
    begin
        result = rb_eval(ruby_class, node->nd_next);
    ensure
        POP_TAG();
        POP_CREF();
        POP_VARS();
        POP_SCOPE();
        POP_CLASS();
        pop FRAME
    end
    return result;
}
```


It does `rb_eval()` with `node->nd_next`,
so it's certain that this is the code of the module body.
The problems are about the others. There are 5 points to see.


* Things occur on `PUSH_SCOPE() PUSH_VARS()`
* How the local variable space is allocated
* The effect of `PUSH_CLASS`
* The relationship between `ruby_cref` and `ruby_frame->cbase`
* What is done by manipulating `ruby_frame`


Let's investigate them in order.




### Creating a local variable scope


`PUSH_SCOPE` pushes a local variable space and `PUSH_VARS()` pushes a block
local variable space, thus a new local variable scope is created by these two.
Let's examine the contents of these macros and what is done.


<p class="caption">▼ `PUSH_SCOPE() POP_SCOPE()` </p>

```c
 852  #define PUSH_SCOPE() do {               \
 853      volatile int _vmode = scope_vmode;  \
 854      struct SCOPE * volatile _old;       \
 855      NEWOBJ(_scope, struct SCOPE);       \
 856      OBJSETUP(_scope, 0, T_SCOPE);       \
 857      _scope->local_tbl = 0;              \
 858      _scope->local_vars = 0;             \
 859      _scope->flags = 0;                  \
 860      _old = ruby_scope;                  \
 861      ruby_scope = _scope;                \
 862      scope_vmode = SCOPE_PUBLIC

 869  #define POP_SCOPE()                                      \
 870      if (ruby_scope->flags & SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE) {        \
 871         if (_old) scope_dup(_old);                        \
 872      }                                                    \
 873      if (!(ruby_scope->flags & SCOPE_MALLOC)) {           \
 874          ruby_scope->local_vars = 0;                      \
 875          ruby_scope->local_tbl  = 0;                      \
 876          if (!(ruby_scope->flags & SCOPE_DONT_RECYCLE) && \
 877              ruby_scope != top_scope) {                   \
 878              rb_gc_force_recycle((VALUE)ruby_scope);      \
 879          }                                                \
 880      }                                                    \
 881      ruby_scope->flags |= SCOPE_NOSTACK;                  \
 882      ruby_scope = _old;                                   \
 883      scope_vmode = _vmode;                                \
 884  } while (0)

(eval.c)
```


As the same as tags, `SCOPE` s also create a stack by being synchronized with the
machine stack. What differentiate slightly is that the spaces of the stack
frames are allocated in the heap, the machine stack is used in order to create
the stack structure (Fig.5.).

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_scopestack.jpg" alt="figure 5: The machine stack and the SCOPE Stack">
  <figcaption>figure 5: The machine stack and the SCOPE Stack</figcaption>
</figure>


Additionally, the flags like `SCOPE_` something repeatedly appearing in the
macros are not able to be explained until I finish to talk all about
in what form each stack frame is remembered and about blocks.
Thus, these will be discussed in Chapter 16: Blocks all at once.




### Allocating the local variable space


As I mentioned many times, the local variable scope is represented by `struct SCOPE`.
But `struct SCOPE` is literally a "scope" and it does not have the real body
to store local variables. To put it more precisely, it has the pointer to a
space but there's still no array at the place where the one points to. The
following part of `module_setup` prepares the array.


<p class="caption">▼The preparation of the local variable slots</p>

```c
3444  if (node->nd_tbl) {
3445      VALUE *vars = TMP_ALLOC(node->nd_tbl[0]+1);
3446      *vars++ = (VALUE)node;
3447      ruby_scope->local_vars = vars;
3448      rb_mem_clear(ruby_scope->local_vars, node->nd_tbl[0]);
3449      ruby_scope->local_tbl = node->nd_tbl;
3450  }
3451  else {
3452      ruby_scope->local_vars = 0;
3453      ruby_scope->local_tbl  = 0;
3454  }

(eval.c)
```


The `TMP_ALLOC()` at the beginning will be described in the next section. If I
put it shortly, it is "`alloca` that is assured to allocate on the stack
(therefore, we do not need to worry about GC)".


`node->nd_tbl` holds in fact the local variable name table that has appeared
in Chapter 12: Syntax tree construction. It means that `nd_tbl[0]` contains the table size and the rest is
an array of `ID`. This table is directly preserved to `local_tbl` of `SCOPE`
and `local_vars` is allocated to store the local variable values.
Because they are confusing, it's a good thing writing some comments such as
"This is the variable name", "this is the value".
The one with `tbl` is for the names.

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_localvars.jpg" alt="figure 6: `ruby_scope->local_vars`">
  <figcaption>figure 6: <code class="inline">ruby_scope->local_vars</code></figcaption>
</figure>


Where is this `node` used?
I examined the all `local_vars` members but could not find the access to index
`-1` in `eval.c`. Expanding the range of files to investigate, I found the
access in `gc.c`.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_gc_mark_children()` — `T_SCOPE` </p>

```c
 815  case T_SCOPE:
 816    if (obj->as.scope.local_vars &&
            (obj->as.scope.flags & SCOPE_MALLOC)) {
 817        int n = obj->as.scope.local_tbl[0]+1;
 818        VALUE *vars = &obj->as.scope.local_vars[-1];
 819
 820        while (n--) {
 821            rb_gc_mark(*vars);
 822            vars++;
 823        }
 824    }
 825    break;

(gc.c)
```


Apparently, this is a mechanism to protect `node` from GC.
But why is it necessary to to mark it here?
`node` is purposefully store into the `volatile` local variable, so
it would not be garbage-collected during the execution of `module_setup()`.


Honestly speaking, I was thinking it might merely be a mistake for a while but
it turned out it's actually very important. The issue is this at the next
line of the next line:


<p class="caption">▼ `ruby_scope->local_tbl` </p>

```c
3449  ruby_scope->local_tbl = node->nd_tbl;

(eval.c)
```


The local variable name table prepared by the parser is directly used. When is
this table freed? It's the time when the `node` become not to be referred from
anywhere. Then, when should `node` be freed? It's the time after the `SCOPE`
assigned on this line will disappear completely. Then, when is that?


`SCOPE` sometimes persists longer than the statement that causes the creation
of it. As it will be discussed at Chapter 16: Blocks,
if a `Proc` object is created, it refers `SCOPE`.
Thus, If `module_setup()` has finished, the `SCOPE` created there is not
necessarily be what is no longer used. That's why it's not sufficient that
`node` is only referred from (the stack frame of) `module_setup()`.
It must be referred "directly" from `SCOPE`.


On the other hand, the `volatile node` of the local variable cannot be removed.
Without it, `node` is floating on air until it will be assigned to `local_vars`.


However then, `local_vars` of `SCOPE` is not safe, isn't it?
`TMP_ALLOC()` is, as I mentioned, the allocation on the stack, it becomes
invalid at the time `module_setup()` ends. This is in fact, at the moment when
`Proc` is created, the allocation method is abruptly switched to `malloc()`.
Details will be described in Chapter 16: Blocks.


Lastly, `rb_mem_clear()` seems zero-filling but actually it is `Qnil` -filling to
an array of `VALUE` (`array.c`). By this, all defined local variables are
initialized as `nil`.




### `TMP_ALLOC`


Next, let's read `TMP_ALLOC` that allocates the local variable space.
This macro is actually paired with `TMP_PROTECT` existing silently at the
beginning of `module_setup()`. Its typical usage is this:



```c
VALUE *ptr;
TMP_PROTECT;

ptr = TMP_ALLOC(size);
```


The reason why `TMP_PROTECT` is in the place for the local variable definitions
is that ... Let's see its definition.


<p class="caption">▼ `TMP_ALLOC()` </p>

```c
1769  #ifdef C_ALLOCA
1770  # define TMP_PROTECT NODE * volatile tmp__protect_tmp=0
1771  # define TMP_ALLOC(n) \
1772      (tmp__protect_tmp = rb_node_newnode(NODE_ALLOCA,                 \
1773                               ALLOC_N(VALUE,n), tmp__protect_tmp, n), \
1774       (void*)tmp__protect_tmp->nd_head)
1775  #else
1776  # define TMP_PROTECT typedef int foobazzz
1777  # define TMP_ALLOC(n) ALLOCA_N(VALUE,n)
1778  #endif

(eval.c)
```


... it is because it defines a local variable.


As described in Chapter 5: Garbage collection, in the environment of `#ifdef C_ALLOCA` (that is,
the native `alloca()` does not exist) `malloca()` is used to emulate `alloca()`.
However, the arguments of a method are obviously `VALUE` s and
the GC could not find a `VALUE` if it is stored in the heap.
Therefore, it is enforced that GC can find it through `NODE`.

<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_tmpprotecttmp.jpg" alt="figure 7: anchor the space to the stack through `NODE`">
  <figcaption>figure 7: anchor the space to the stack through <code class="inline">NODE</code></figcaption>
</figure>


On the contrary, in the environment with the true `alloca()`, we can naturally
use `alloca()` and there's no need to use `TMP_PROTECT`. Thus, a harmless
statement is arbitrarily written.


By the way, why do they want to use `alloca()` very much by all means.
It's merely because " `alloca()` is faster than `malloc()`", they said.
One can think that it's not so worth to care about such tiny difference,
but because the core of the evaluator is the biggest bottleneck of `ruby`,
... the same as above.




### Changing the place to define methods on.


The value of the stack `ruby_class` is the place to define a method on at the
time. Conversely, if one push a value to `ruby_class`, it changes the class to
define a method on. This is exactly what is necessary for a class statement.
Therefore, It's also necessary to do `PUSH_CLASS()` in `module_setup()`.
Here is the code for it:



```c
PUSH_CLASS();
ruby_class = module;
     ：
     ：
POP_CLASS();
```


Why is there the assignment to `ruby_class` after doing `PUSH_CLASS()`.
We can understand it unexpectedly easily by looking at the definition.


<p class="caption">▼ `PUSH_CLASS() POP_CLASS()` </p>

```c
 841  #define PUSH_CLASS() do { \
 842      VALUE _class = ruby_class

 844  #define POP_CLASS() ruby_class = _class; \
 845  } while (0)

(eval.c)
```


Because `ruby_class` is not modified even though `PUSH_CLASS` is done,
it is not actually pushed until setting by hand.
Thus, these two are closer to "save and restore" rather than "push and pop".


You might think that it can be a cleaner macro if passing a class as the
argument of `PUSH_CLASS()` ... It's absolutely true, but because there are some
places we cannot obtain the class before pushing, it is in this way.




### Nesting Classes

`ruby_cref` represents the class nesting information at runtime. Therefore, it's
naturally predicted that `ruby_cref` will be pushed on the module statements or
on the class statements.
In `module_setup()`, it is pushed as follows:



```TODO
PUSH_CREF(module);
ruby_frame->cbase = (VALUE)ruby_cref;
   ：
   ：
POP_CREF();
```


Here, `module` is the module being defined.
Let's also see the definitions of `PUSH_CREF()` and `POP_CREF()`.


<p class="caption">▼ `PUSH_CREF() POP_CREF()` </p>

```c
 849  #define PUSH_CREF(c) \
          ruby_cref = rb_node_newnode(NODE_CREF,(c),0,ruby_cref)
 850  #define POP_CREF() ruby_cref = ruby_cref->nd_next

(eval.c)
```


Unlike `PUSH_SCOPE` or something, there are not any complicated techniques and
it's very easy to deal with.
It's also not good if there's completely not any such thing.


The problem remains unsolved is what is the meaning of `ruby_frame->cbase`.
It is the information to refer a class variable or a constant from the current `FRAME`.
Details will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.




### Replacing frames


Lastly, let's focus on the manipulation of `ruby_frame`. The first thing is its
definition:



```c
struct FRAME frame;
```


It is not a pointer. This means that the entire `FRAME` is allocated on the stack.
Both the management structure of the Ruby stack and the local variable
space are on the stack, but in the case of `FRAME` the entire struct is stored
on the stack. The extreme consumption of the machine stack by `ruby` is the
fruit of these "small techniques" piling up.


Then next, let's look at where doing several things with `frame`.



```c
frame = *ruby_frame;      /* copy the entire struct */
frame.tmp = ruby_frame;   /* protect the original FRAME from GC */
ruby_frame = &frame;      /* replace ruby_frame */
       ：
       ：
ruby_frame = frame.tmp;   /* restore */
```


That is, `ruby_frame` seems temporarily replaced (not pushing).
Why is it doing such thing?


I described that `FRAME` is "pushed on method calls", but to be more precise,
it is the stack frame to represent "the main environment to execute a Ruby program".
You can infer it from, for instance, `ruby_frame->cbase` which appeared previously.
`last_func` which is "the last called method name" also suggests it.


Then, why is `FRAME` not straightforwardly pushed?
It is because this is the place where it is not allowed to push `FRAME`.
`FRAME` is wanted to be pushed, but if `FRAME` is pushed,
it will appear in the backtraces of the program when an exception occurs.
The backtraces are things displayed like followings:



```
% ruby t.rb
t.rb:11:in `c': some error occured (ArgumentError)
        from t.rb:7:in `b'
        from t.rb:3:in `a'
        from t.rb:14
```


But the module statements and the class statements are not method calls,
so it is not desirable to appear in this. That's why it is "replaced" instead
of "pushed".






The method definition
---------------------


As the next topic of the module definitions, let's look at the method definitions.


### Investigation


<p class="caption">▼The Source Program</p>

```ruby
def m(a, b, c)
  nil
end
```


<p class="caption">▼Its Syntax Tree</p>

```
NODE_DEFN
nd_mid  = 9617 (m)
nd_noex = 2 (NOEX_PRIVATE)
nd_defn:
    NODE_SCOPE
    nd_rval = (null)
    nd_tbl = 5 [ _ ~ a b c ]
    nd_next:
        NODE_ARGS
        nd_cnt  = 3
        nd_rest = -1
        nd_opt = (null)
        NODE_NIL
```


I dumped several things and found that there's always `NODE_SCOPE` in `nd_defn`.
`NODE_SCOPE` is, as we've seen at the module statements,
the node to store the information to push a local variable scope.




### `NODE_DEFN`


Subsequently, we will examine the corresponding code of `rb_eval()`. This part
contains a lot of error handlings and tedious, they are all omitted again.
The way of omitting is as usual, deleting the every parts to directly or
indirectly call `rb_raise() rb_warn() rb_warning()`.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_DEFN` (simplified)</p>

```c
NODE *defn;
int noex;

if (SCOPE_TEST(SCOPE_PRIVATE) || node->nd_mid == init) {
    noex = NOEX_PRIVATE;                 （A）
}
else if (SCOPE_TEST(SCOPE_PROTECTED)) {
    noex = NOEX_PROTECTED;               （B）
}
else if (ruby_class == rb_cObject) {
    noex =  node->nd_noex;               （C）
}
else {
    noex = NOEX_PUBLIC;                  （D）
}

defn = copy_node_scope(node->nd_defn, ruby_cref);
rb_add_method(ruby_class, node->nd_mid, defn, noex);
result = Qnil;
```


In the first half, there are the words like `private` or `protected`, so it is
probably related to visibility. `noex`, which is used as the names of flags,
seems `NOde EXposure`. Let's examine the `if` statements in order.


(A) `SCOPE_TEST()` is a macro to check if there's an argument flag in
`scope_vmode`. Therefore, the first half of this conditional statement means
"is it a `private` scope?".
The last half means "it's `private` if this is defining `initialize`".
The method `initialize` to initialize an object will unquestionably become `private`.


(B) It is `protected` if the scope is `protected` (not surprisingly).
My feeling is that there're few cases `protected` is required in Ruby.


==(C)== This is a bug. I found this just before the submission of this book,
so I couldn't fix this beforehand.
In the latest code this part is probably already removed.
The original intention is to enforce the methods defined at top level to be `private`.


(D) If it is not any of the above conditions, it is `public`.


Actually, there's not a thing to worth to care about until here. The important
part is the next two lines.



```c
defn = copy_node_scope(node->nd_defn, ruby_cref);
rb_add_method(ruby_class, node->nd_mid, defn, noex);
```


`copy_node_scope()` is a function to copy (only) `NODE_SCOPE` attached to the
top of the method body. It is important that `ruby_cref` is passed ...
but details will be described soon.


After copying, the definition is finished by adding it by `rb_add_method()`.
The place to define on is of course `ruby_class`.




### `copy_node_scope()`


`copy_node_scope()` is called only from the two places: the method definition
(`NODE_DEFN`) and the singleton method definition (`NODE_DEFS`) in `rb_eval()`.
Therefore,  looking at these two is sufficient to detect how it is used. Plus,
the usages at these two places are almost the same.


<p class="caption">▼ `copy_node_scope()` </p>

```c
1752  static NODE*
1753  copy_node_scope(node, rval)
1754      NODE *node;
1755      VALUE rval;
1756  {
1757      NODE *copy = rb_node_newnode(NODE_SCOPE,0,rval,node->nd_next);
1758
1759      if (node->nd_tbl) {
1760          copy->nd_tbl = ALLOC_N(ID, node->nd_tbl[0]+1);
1761          MEMCPY(copy->nd_tbl, node->nd_tbl, ID, node->nd_tbl[0]+1);
1762      }
1763      else {
1764          copy->nd_tbl = 0;
1765      }
1766      return copy;
1767  }

(eval.c)
```


I mentioned that the argument `rval` is the information of the class nesting
(`ruby_cref`) of when the method is defined. Apparently, it is `rval` because it
will be set to `nd_rval`.


In the main `if` statement copies `nd_tbl` of `NODE_SCOPE`.
It is a local variable name table in other words. The +1 at `ALLOC_N` is to
additionally allocate the space for `nd_tbl[0]`.  As we've seen in Part 2,
`nd_tbl[0]` holds the local variables count, that was "the actual length of
`nd_tbl` - 1".


To summarize, `copy_node_scope()` makes a copy of the `NODE_SCOPE` which is the
header of the method body. However, `nd_rval` is additionally set and it is the
`ruby_cref` (the class nesting information) of when the class is defined. This
information will be used later when referring constants or class variables.




### `rb_add_method()`


The next thing is `rb_add_method()` that is the function to register a method entry.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_add_method()` </p>

```c
 237  void
 238  rb_add_method(klass, mid, node, noex)
 239      VALUE klass;
 240      ID mid;
 241      NODE *node;
 242      int noex;
 243  {
 244      NODE *body;
 245
 246      if (NIL_P(klass)) klass = rb_cObject;
 247      if (ruby_safe_level >= 4 &&
              (klass == rb_cObject || !OBJ_TAINTED(klass))) {
 248          rb_raise(rb_eSecurityError, "Insecure: can't define method");
 249      }
 250      if (OBJ_FROZEN(klass)) rb_error_frozen("class/module");
 251      rb_clear_cache_by_id(mid);
 252      body = NEW_METHOD(node, noex);
 253      st_insert(RCLASS(klass)->m_tbl, mid, body);
 254  }

(eval.c)
```


`NEW_METHOD()` is a macro to create `NODE`.
`rb_clear_cache_by_id()` is a function to manipulate the method cache.
This will be explained in the next chapter "Method".


Let's look at the syntax tree which is eventually stored in `m_tbl` of a class.
I prepared `nodedump-method` for this kind of purposes.
(`nodedump-method` : comes with `nodedump`. `nodedump` is `tools/nodedump.tar.gz` of the attached CD-ROM)



```
% ruby -e '
class C
  def m(a)
    puts "ok"
  end
end
require "nodedump-method"
NodeDump.dump C, :m        # dump the method m of the class C
'
NODE_METHOD
nd_noex = 0 (NOEX_PUBLIC)
nd_cnt = 0
nd_body:
    NODE_SCOPE
    nd_rval = Object <- C
    nd_tbl = 3 [ _ ~ a ]
    nd_next:
        NODE_ARGS
        nd_cnt  = 1
        nd_rest = -1
        nd_opt = (null)
        U牙S頏著


** unhandled**


```


There are `NODE_METHOD` at the top
and `NODE_SCOPE` previously copied by `copy_node_scope()` at the next.
These probably represent the header of a method.
I dumped several things and there's not any `NODE_SCOPE` with the methods defined in C,
thus it seems to indicate that the method is defined at Ruby level.


Additionally, at `nd_tbl` of `NODE_SCOPE` the parameter variable name ( `a` ) appears.
I mentioned that the parameter variables are equivalent to the local variables,
and this briefly implies it.


I'll omit the explanation about `NODE_ARGS` here
because it will be described at the next chapter "Method".


Lastly, the `nd_cnt` of the `NODE_METHOD`, it's not so necessary to care about
this time. It is used when having to do with `alias`.






Assignment and Reference
------------------------


Come to think of it, most of the stacks are used to realize a variety of
variables. We have learned to push various stacks, this time let's examine the
code to reference variables.




### Local variable


The all necessary information to assign or refer local variables has appeared,
so you are probably able to predict.
There are the following two points:


* local variable scope is an array which is pointed by `ruby_scope->local_vars`
* the correspondence between each local variable name and each array index has
  already resolved at the parser level.


Therefore, the code for the local variable reference node `NODE_LVAR` is as
follows:


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_LVAR` </p>

```c
2975  case NODE_LVAR:
2976    if (ruby_scope->local_vars == 0) {
2977        rb_bug("unexpected local variable");
2978    }
2979    result = ruby_scope->local_vars[node->nd_cnt];
2980    break;

(eval.c)
```


It goes without saying but `node->nd_cnt` is the value that `local_cnt()` of the
parser returns.




### Constant


#### Complete Specification


In Chapter 6: Variables and constants,
I talked about in what form constants are stored and API.
Constants are belong to classes and inherited as the same as methods.
As for their actual appearances, they are registered to `iv_tbl` of
`struct RClass` with instance variables and class variables.


The searching path of a constant is firstly the outer class, secondly the
superclass, however, `rb_const_get()` only searches the superclass. Why?
To answer this question, I need to reveal the last specification of constants.
Take a look at the following code:



```ruby
class A
  C = 5
  def A.new
    puts C
    super
  end
end
```


`A.new` is a singleton method of `A`, so its class is the singleton class `(A)`.
If it is interpreted by following the rule,
it cannot obtain the constant `C` which is belongs to `A`.


But because it is written so close, to become to want refer the constant `C`
is human nature. Therefore, such reference is possible in Ruby.
It can be said that this specification reflects the characteristic of Ruby
"The emphasis is on the appearance of the source code".


If I generalize this rule, when referring a constant from inside of a method,
by setting the place which the method definition is "written" as the start
point, it refers the constant of the outer class.
And, "the class of where the method is written" depends on its context,
thus it could not be handled without the information from both the parser and
the evaluator. This is why `rb_cost_get()` did not have the searching path of
the outer class.




#### `cbase`


Then, let's look at the code to refer constants including the outer class.
The ordinary constant references to which `::` is not attached, become
`NODE_CONST` in the syntax tree. The corresponding code in `rb_eval()` is ...


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_CONST` </p>

```c
2994  case NODE_CONST:
2995    result = ev_const_get(RNODE(ruby_frame->cbase), node->nd_vid, self);
2996    break;

(eval.c)
```


First, `nd_vid` appears to be `Variable ID` and it probably means a constant name.
And, `ruby_frame->cbase` is "the class where the method definition is written".
The value will be set when invoking the method, thus the code to set has not appeared yet.
And the place where the value to be set comes from is the `nd_rval`
that has appeared in `copy_node_scope()` of the method definition.
I'd like you to go back a little and check that the member holds the
`ruby_cref` of when the method is defined.


This means, first, the `ruby_cref` link is built when defining a class or a module.
Assume that the just defined class is `C` (Fig.81),


Defining the method `m` (this is probably `C#m` ) here,
then the current `ruby_cref` is memorized by the method entry (Fig.82).

After that, when the class statement finished the `ruby_cref` would start to
point another node, but `node->nd_rval` naturally continues to point to the
same thing. (Fig.83)


Then, when invoking the method `C#m`, get `node->nd_rval`
and insert into the just pushed `ruby_frame->cbase`  (Fig.84)


... This is the mechanism. Complicated.

  <figcaption>figure 8: CREF Transfer</figcaption>
</figure>


#### `ev_const_get()`

Now, let's go back to the code of `NODE_CONST`.
Since only `ev_const_get()` is left, we'll look at it.


<p class="caption">▼ `ev_const_get()` </p>

```c
1550  static VALUE
1551  ev_const_get(cref, id, self)
1552      NODE *cref;
1553      ID id;
1554      VALUE self;
1555  {
1556      NODE *cbase = cref;
1557      VALUE result;
1558
1559      while (cbase && cbase->nd_next) {
1560          VALUE klass = cbase->nd_clss;
1561
1562          if (NIL_P(klass)) return rb_const_get(CLASS_OF(self), id);
1563          if (RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl &&
                  st_lookup(RCLASS(klass)->iv_tbl, id, &result)) {
1564              return result;
1565          }
1566          cbase = cbase->nd_next;
1567      }
1568      return rb_const_get(cref->nd_clss, id);
1569  }

(eval.c)
```


(( According to the errata, the description of `ev_const_get()` was wrong.
   I omit this part for now. ))





### Class variable


What class variables refer to is also `ruby_cref`. Needless to say,
unlike the constants which search over the outer classes one after another,
it uses only the first element.
Let's look at the code of `NODE_CVAR` which is the node to refer to a class
variable.


What is the `cvar_cbase()` ? As `cbase` is attached,
it is probably related to `ruby_frame->cbase`, but how do they differ?
Let's look at it.


<p class="caption">▼ `cvar_cbase()` </p>

```c
1571  static VALUE
1572  cvar_cbase()
1573  {
1574      NODE *cref = RNODE(ruby_frame->cbase);
1575
1576      while (cref && cref->nd_next &&
                 FL_TEST(cref->nd_clss, FL_SINGLETON)) {
1577          cref = cref->nd_next;
1578          if (!cref->nd_next) {
1579    rb_warn("class variable access from toplevel singleton method");
1580          }
1581      }
1582      return cref->nd_clss;
1583  }

(eval.c)
```


It traverses `cbase` up to the class that is not the singleton class, it
seems. This feature is added to counter the following kind of code:



```ruby
class C                           class C
  @@cvar = 1                        @@cvar = 1
  class << C                        def C.m
    def m                             @@cvar
      @@cvar                        end
    end                             def C.m2
    def m2                            @@cvar + @@cvar
      @@cvar + @@cvar               end
    end                           end
  end
end
```


Both the left and right code ends up defining the same method,
but if you write in the way of the right side it is tedious to write the class
name repeatedly as the number of methods increases. Therefore, when defining
multiple singleton methods, many people choose to write in the left side way
of using the singleton class definition statement to bundle.


However, these two differs in the value of `ruby_cref`. The one using the
singleton class definition is `ruby_cref=(C)` and the other one defining
singleton methods separately is `ruby_cref=C`. This may cause to differ in the
places where class variables refer to, so this is not convenient.


Therefore, assuming it's rare case to define class variables on singleton
classes, it skips over singleton classes. This reflects again that the emphasis
is more on the usability rather than the consistency.


And, when the case is a constant reference,
since it searches all of the outer classes,
`C` is included in the search path in either way, so there's no problem.
Plus, as for an assignment, since it couldn't be written inside methods in the
first place, it is also not related.





### Multiple Assignment


If someone asked "where is the most complicated specification of Ruby?", I
would instantly answer that it is multiple assignment.
It is even impossible to understand the big picture of multiple assignment, I
have an account of why I think so. In short, the specification of the multiple
assignment is defined without even a subtle intention to construct so that the
whole specification is well-organized. The basis of the specification is always
"the behavior which seems convenient in several typical use cases". This can be
said about the entire Ruby, but particularly about the multiple assignment.


Then, how could we avoid being lost in the jungle of codes. This is similar to
reading the stateful scanner and it is not seeing the whole picture. There's
no whole picture in the first place, we could not see it. Cutting the code into
blocks like, this code is written for this specification, that code is written
for that specification, ... understanding the
correspondences one by one in such manner is the only way.


But this book is to understand the overall structure of `ruby` and is not
"Advanced Ruby Programming". Thus, dealing with very tiny things is not fruitful.
So here, we only think about the basic structure of multiple assignment
and the very simple "multiple-to-multiple" case.


First, following the standard, let's start with the syntax tree.


<p class="caption">▼The Source Program</p>

```ruby
a, b = 7, 8
```


<p class="caption">▼Its Syntax Tree</p>

```
NODE_MASGN
nd_head:
    NODE_ARRAY [
    0:
        NODE_LASGN
        nd_cnt = 2
        nd_value:
    1:
        NODE_LASGN
        nd_cnt = 3
        nd_value:
    ]
nd_value:
    NODE_REXPAND
    nd_head:
        NODE_ARRAY [
        0:
            NODE_LIT
            nd_lit = 7:Fixnum
        1:
            NODE_LIT
            nd_lit = 8:Fixnum
        ]
```


Both the left-hand and right-hand sides are the lists of `NODE_ARRAY`,
there's additionally `NODE_REXPAND` in the right side. `REXPAND` may be "Right
value EXPAND". We are curious about what this node is doing. Let's see.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_REXPAND` </p>

```c
2575  case NODE_REXPAND:
2576    result = avalue_to_svalue(rb_eval(self, node->nd_head));
2577    break;

(eval.c)
```


You can ignore `avalue_to_svalue()`.
`NODE_ARRAY` is evaluated by `rb_eval()`, (because it is the node of the array
literal), it is turned into a Ruby array and returned back.
So, before the left-hand side is handled, all in the right-hand side are
evaluated. This enables even the following code:



```ruby
a, b = b, a    # swap variables in oneline
```


Let's look at `NODE_MASGN` in the left-hand side.


<p class="caption">▼ `rb_eval()` − `NODE_MASGN` </p>

```c
2923  case NODE_MASGN:
2924    result = massign(self, node, rb_eval(self, node->nd_value),0);
2925    break;

(eval.c)
```


Here is only the evaluation of the right-hand side, the rests are delegated to
`massign()`.




#### `massign()`


<p class="caption">▼ `massi` ……</p>

```c
3917  static VALUE
3918  massign(self, node, val, pcall)
3919      VALUE self;
3920      NODE *node;
3921      VALUE val;
3922      int pcall;
3923  {

(eval.c)
```


I'm sorry this is halfway, but I'd like you to stop and pay attention to the
4th argument. `pcall` is `Proc CALL`, this indicates whether or not the
function is used to call `Proc` object. Between `Proc` calls and the others
there's a little difference in the strictness of the check of the multiple
assignments, so a flag is received to check.
Obviously, the value is decided to be either 0 or 1.


Then, I'd like you to look at the previous code calling `massign()`, it was
`pcall=0`. Therefore, we probably don't mind if assuming it is `pcall=0` for the
time being and extracting the variables. That is, when there's an argument like
`pcall` which is slightly changing the behavior, we always need to consider the
two patterns of scenarios, so it is really cumbersome. If there's only one
actual function `massign()`, to think as if there were two functions, `pcall=0`
and `pcall=1`, is way simpler to read.


When writing a program we must avoid duplications as much as possible,
but this principle is unrelated if it is when reading.
If patterns are limited,
copying it and letting it to be redundant is rather the right approach.
There are wordings "optimize for speed" "optimize for the code size",
in this case we'll "optimize for readability".


So, assuming it is `pcall=0` and cutting the codes as much as possible and the
final appearance is shown as follows:


<p class="caption">▼ `massign()` (simplified)</p>

```c
static VALUE
massign(self, node, val  /* , pcall=0 */)
    VALUE self;
    NODE *node;
    VALUE val;
{
    NODE *list;
    long i = 0, len;

    val = svalue_to_mvalue(val);
    len = RARRAY(val)->len;
    list = node->nd_head;
    /* （A） */
    for (i=0; list && i<len; i++) {
        assign(self, list->nd_head, RARRAY(val)->ptr[i], pcall);
        list = list->nd_next;
    }
    /* （B） */
    if (node->nd_args) {
        if (node->nd_args == (NODE*)-1) {
            /* no check for mere `*' */
        }
        else if (!list && i<len) {
            assign(self, node->nd_args,
                   rb_ary_new4(len-i, RARRAY(val)->ptr+i), pcall);
        }
        else {
            assign(self, node->nd_args, rb_ary_new2(0), pcall);
        }
    }

    /* （C） */
    while (list) {
        i++;
        assign(self, list->nd_head, Qnil, pcall);
        list = list->nd_next;
    }
    return val;
}
```


`val` is the right-hand side value. And there's the suspicious conversion called
`svalue_to_mvalue()`, since `mvalue_to_svalue()` appeared previously and
`svalue_to_mvalue()` in this time, so you can infer "it must be getting back".
((errata: it was `avalue_to_svalue()` in the previous case.
Therefore, it's hard to infer "getting back", but you can ignore them anyway.))
Thus, the both are deleted. In the next line, since it uses `RARRAY()`,
you can infer that the right-hand side value is an `Array` of Ruby.
Meanwhile, the left-hand side is `node->nd_head`, so it is the value assigned to
the local variable `list`. This `list` is also a node (`NODE_ARRAY`).


We'll look at the code by clause.


(A) `assign` is, as the name suggests, a function to perform an one-to-one
assignment. Since the left-hand side is expressed by a node,
if it is, for instance, `NODE_IASGN` (an assignment to an instance variable),
it assigns with `rb_ivar_set()`.
So, what it is doing here is adjusting to either `list` and `val` which is
shorter and doing one-to-one assignments. (Fig.9)


<figure>
  <img src="images/ch_module_massign.jpg" alt="figure 9: assign when corresponded">
  <figcaption>figure 9: assign when corresponded</figcaption>
</figure>


(B) if there are remainders on the right-hand side, turn them into a Ruby
array and assign it into (the left-hand side expressed by) the `node->nd_args`.


==(C)== if there are remainders on the left-hand side, assign `nil` to all of them.



By the way, the procedure which is assuming `pcall=0` then cutting out is very
similar to the data flow analytics / constant foldings used on the optimization
phase of compilers.
Therefore, we can probably automate it to some extent.
