About this Guide

This is a new effort to gather efforts to help translate
\[Ruby Hacking Guide\](http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/book/) into English.

The official support site of the original book is
http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/

You can download the version of the source code explained and
the tool used in the book
from the official support site of the original book.

- \[ruby (1.7.3 2002-09-12) in tar.gz format\](http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/ruby-rhg.tar.gz)
- \[ruby (1.7.3 2002-09-12) in zip format\](http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/ruby-rhg.zip)
- \[Pragmatic Programmers' nodeDump 0.1.7\](http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/nodeDump-0.1.7.tgz)
- \[RHG-version nodedump\](http://i.loveruby.net/ja/rhg/ar/nodedump-rhg.tar.gz)

The original translating project is hosted at RubyForge
http://rubyforge.org/projects/rhg

Many thanks to \[RubyForge\](http://rubyforge.org) for hosting us and to
Minero AOKI for letting us translate his work.

You can get further information about this project from
\[the archives of rhg-discussion mailing list\](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rhg-discussion/)

There is an old SVN repo, that is hosted at
The RubyForge project page is http://rubyforge.org/projects/rhg.
It has been imported here, and I will attempt to give credit and re-write the
SVN/Git history when I can.

As for now the contributors to that repo were:

- Vincent ISAMBART
- meinrad recheis
- Laurent Sansonetti
- Clifford Caoile
