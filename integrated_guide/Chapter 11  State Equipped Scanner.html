<h1>Chapter 11: State Equipped Scanner</h1>


<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> 
In theory, the scanner simply  divides a source line in tokens.&nbsp&nbsp The parser
then steps through the tokens branching as appropriate to compute the desired action.&nbsp&nbsp 
It would seem that scanner and the parser could act independently.&nbsp&nbsp But as usual with 
real world,&nbsp it does not work out that way.
</p> 
<p> 
It turns out that the scanner and parser have to work together.&nbsp&nbsp The result for Ruby is a reasonably complex state machine driven scanner that feeds the parser to produce the correct result.&nbsp&nbsp To be clear,&nbsp  both the scanner and the parser manipulate the state variable of the scanner.&nbsp&nbsp In other words, the scanner and the parser are talking to each other.
</p> 



<h3>Concrete example</h3>

<p> 
In many languages white-space outside string literals does not greatly effect the language.&nbsp&nbsp Source lines are often terminated explicitly.&nbsp&nbsp  In 'C' a source line is terminated with a semi-colon ( ';' )&nbsp  or the closing of a block (i.e. '}' ). 
</p>
<p> 
For Ruby the interpretation of a statement can change completely when additional tokens are processed.&nbsp&nbsp The source fragment "a[i]" can be,&nbsp depending on context,&nbsp either an <i>indexed variable</i>&nbsp or a <i>method call with implicit parenthesis's</i>.
</p> 
<pre class="graylist">
a[i] = 1                # a[i] = (1) - Index substitution 
a[i]                    # a([i])     - Method with implicit parameter.
</pre>
<p> 
This sort of dramatic change in interpretation occurs in Ruby because the language itself is has a very flexible syntax.&nbsp&nbsp Ask yourself,&nbsp how many languages allow implicit parenthesis's?&nbsp&nbsp 
</p> 
<p> 
Ruby's flexible syntax means that a blank can change how a statement is interpreted by Ruby.&nbsp  Consider the following two statements: 
</p> 
<pre class="graylist">
a + 1              # (a) + (1)
a +1               #  a (+1)
</pre>
<p> 
The first example is interpreted as:  &lt;variable&gt &lt;op&gt &lt;literal integer&gt.&nbsp&nbsp The second is interpreted as: &lt;method&gt &lt;literal integer parameter&gt.&nbsp&nbsp The same setup in 'C',&nbsp for example,&nbsp  would be interpreted identically.
</p> 
<p> 
The bottom line is that the parsing and scanning is more complex with Ruby.&nbsp&nbsp The following sections will attempt to break the scanner down into small enough pieces to be understood.
</p> 

<h3><code>Function yylex()</code></h3>
<p> 
The heart of the lexical scanner is <b>yylex()</b>.&nbsp&nbsp This function is often generated with the programs such as <b>lex</b>&nbsp or <b>flex</b>.&nbsp&nbsp In the case of Ruby,&nbsp the complexity of this function necessitated a hand written <i>State Equipped Scanner</i>&nbsp  that interacts the a <i>Bison</i> generated parser. 
</p> 
<p> 
The following sections discuss the various scanner states and their functions. 
</p> 
<h3><code>Lex_state</code></h3>
<p>
The current <i>state</i>&nbsp of the scanner is maintained the variable <b><i>lex_state</i></b>.&nbsp&nbsp It's declaration and the definition of it's enumerated states follows:
</p> 
<pre class="greenlist">
static enum lex_state {
    EXPR_BEG,        /* ignore newline, +/- is a sign.              */
    EXPR_END,        /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_ARG,        /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_CMDARG,     /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_ENDARG,     /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_MID,        /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_FNAME,      /* ignore newline, no reserved words.          */
    EXPR_DOT,        /* right after `.' or `::', no reserved words. */
    EXPR_CLASS,      /* immediate after `class', no here document.  */
} lex_state;

(parse.y)
</pre>
<p> 
The prefix <b>'EXPR_'</b>&nbsp means <i>expression</i>.&nbsp&nbsp It is used remind us that the scanner is a expression processing engine.
</p> 
<p> 
Specifically, EXPR_BEG indicates the <i>beginning of the expression</i>. EXPR_END indicates the <i>end of the expression</i>, EXPR_ARG <i>before method arguments</i>, and EXPR_FNAME before the name of the method (def, etc).
</p> 
<hr>
<font size=+3 color=BLUE>Rest of Chapter is Machine Translation</font>
<hr>
<p> 
The prefix <code> EXPR_ </code> of expression, "expression". <code> EXPR_BEG </code>, "the head of the expression" 
However <code> EXPR_DOT </code> "during the ceremony, after the dot." 
</p> 

<p> 
Specifically explain. <code> EXPR_BEG </code> is "the beginning of expression," it shows. 
<code> EXPR_END </code> "at the end of the expression" the war. <code> EXPR_ARG </code> "method of argument" 
Show. <code> EXPR_FNAME </code> is "(<code> def </code> and others) in the name of the method".飛ばexplanation 
After the analysis of them in detail. 
</p> 

<p> 
By the way, <code> lex_state </code> shows that are "in parentheses after" "head sentence", rather it 
The addition of that information, so that the scanner rather than the state of the state like parser 
Feel. But the scanner is usually called the state. Why? 
</p> 

<p> 
In fact, in this case, "state" is usually used "state" is a little different meaning. 
<code> lex_state </code> like "state" and the "state of the scanner would behave" 
Means. For example <code> EXPR_BEG </code> to precisely "We own head scanner 
Beginning of a sentence or salted cod to move like a state. " 
</p> 

<p> 
In technical terms, use the scanner to see if the state machine and the state, say 
Be. But what is there to explain the topics are too hard to break away from the SU 
GIRU. Details of the structure of the data to the proper textbooks to read the見繕っ. 
KITAI. 
</p> 



<h3> state with a scanner reading </h3> 

<p> 
State with a scanner to read the tips at any one time and not win them all. Par 
Write for human services, with state does not want to use the scanner. 
It is only natural that I do not want to be the main topic of the process. So scanner 
The state management that is "associated with other parts of the trail as a bonus part" of 
There are many. That is the entire state transition scanner It's a beautiful picture of the whole thing from the beginning 
Existent. 
</p> 

<p> 
What to do, and that the purpose-oriented and thorough It's a good read. "The 
Solve this part, "" to solve this problem, this code is Oh 
Of "the way the code to hack purpose. It's also the problem of interconnectedness 
And never to start thinking about the shot. Say again, that is from the original source of 
INODA. 
</p> 

<p> 
Yet it is a certain amount of goals is necessary. Read with a scanner and the state 
KINO goal is for each state than any other state to know what it is to put 
Should be. For example <code> EXPR_BEG </code> What kind of state? It is an expression of the head and parser 
Of it. And so on. 
</p> 

<h4> static way </h4> 

<p> 
That is, how can I know? Three ways. 
</p> 

<ul> 
<li> state to see the name </li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
ATARIMAE the easiest way. For example <code> EXPR_BEG </code> of course, the beginning of something 
(Beginning) of what is expected, which they knew. 
</p> 

<ul> 
How <li> behavior change in the status or details </li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
Cutting the state-token or change in the way of what is. And the ratio of real movement and 
Shown to all. 
</p> 

<ul> 
<li> transition from state to tell me what you see </li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
What kind of tokens from any state, or out of the transition. For example <code> '\ n' </code> after the Essential 
ZU <code> HEAD </code>, the status of the transition, it is sure to represent the beginning of the line 
Sure. 
</p> 

<p> 
<code> EXPR_BEG </code> as an example to think. 
<code> ruby </code> If the state transition are all <code> lex_state </code> expressed in the assignment because it will 
ZU <code> EXPR_BEG </code> assignment <code> grep </code> in the wash. That's where it is then exported. For example 
<code> yylex () </code>-<code >'#'</code> and <code >'*'</code> and <code >'!'</code>…… and the like. And before the transition into consideration the state 
That's true if you consider what (Figure 1).

<p> 
Oh I see, this is exactly the type of top-laden statement. Known. 
In particular <code> '\ n' </code> and <code >';'</code>-tempered around it. And also open parentheses or comma 
From there, this statement is not only an expression would be the beginning. 
</p> 

<h4> dynamic way </h4> 

<p> 
With a more convenient way to ascertain the actual behavior. For example debugger 
<code> yylex () </code> on a hook <code> lex_state </code> easy to see.

<h2> new line of control </h2> 

<h3> problem </h3> 

<p> 
Ruby's sentence need not necessarily end. C or Java, for example, be sure to end 
I have not put a semicolon is, Ruby does not need such things. 
The basic line in one sentence, so the line at liberty to the end of the sentence. 
</p> 

<p> 
But on the other hand "is more clear," If the sentence is automatically continue to 
In the world. "Clearly there is more" state and the 
</p> 

<ul> 
<li> comma after </li> 
<li> INFIKKUSU operator after </li> 
<li> parentheses not balanced </li> 
<li> reserved word <code> if </code> immediately after </li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
And so on. 
</p> 


<h3> implementation </h3> 

<p> 
Such a grammar to achieve what? Simply scanner 
Skip a line break is not alone. Ruby as a reserved word in a sentence ends区切 
In the C language grammar is not about the collision, tried it lightly, <code> return </code>, 
<code> next </code>, <code> break </code>, the method calls are cut back and通らなかったomitted parentheses. 
That's the end of a sentence is to leave the sign will not have some form of termination. 
That's <code> \ n </code> or <code >';'</code> regardless of whether they simply mark the end of some 
Needed. 
</p> 

<p> 
There are two solutions. That is parser or resolve or settle in the scanner. 
Parser would be resolved, <code> \ n </code> be allowed at all options <code> \ n </code> to rest 
Grammar kick like if I can write. If you settle in the scanner, <code> \ n </code> meaningful 
Where there is only <code> \ n </code> I pass a parser (skip other locations). 
</p> 

<p> 
Whether to use is a question of taste, but usually respond to the scanner. The more you 
I have a small number, and what the rules are messing about good sign 
PASAJENERETA in the use of those means they are missing. 
</p> 

<p> 
That's not to say in conclusion <code> ruby </code> new line is also dealing with the scanner. Successive lines 
When you want to continue <code> \ n </code> skip to the end you want <code> \ n </code> send as a token. 
That's <code> yylex () </code> here. 
</p>

<code> EXPR_BEG </code> <code> EXPR_FNAME </code> <code> EXPR_DOT </code> <code> EXPR_CLASS </code>, <code> goto retry </code>, 
That is meaningless because it skipped. Labels <code> retry </code> is <code> yylex () </code> giant <code> switch </code> of 
Before.

<p> 
Others at the new line is meant to pass parser, incidentally 
<code> lex_state </code> and <code> EXPR_BEG </code> back. There is a new line means namely <code> expr </code> break 
So.

<p> 
Also <code> command_start </code> for the time being and should be ignored. The first said, 
In many places at once and be sure to follow the confusion.

To continue following paragraph. 
</p> 














<h2> reserved words the same methods name </h2> 

<h3> problem </h3> 

<p> 
Ruby is a reserved word in a method to use that name. However name of the method to use 
And a mouthful to say but there are some context, 
</p> 

<ul> 
<li> method definition (<code> def xxxx </code>) </li> 
<li> call (<code> obj.xxxx </code>) </li> 
<li> literal symbols (<code>: xxxx </code>) </li> 
</ul> 

<p> 
The three could be used. Ruby is all this is possible. Each of the following 
Let us consider. 
</p> 

<p> 
First, define the method has its own reserved words <code> def </code> likely to be preceded by, so we managed. 
</p> 

<p> 
Method calls for the receiver to skip a lot of difficulty will be that of 
Of them, but further specification is not limited to, and those are not allowed. - 
Book word method means that if the name is never a receiver can not be omitted. Or 
Is that right Perth designed to be able to say what might be the 
. 
</p> 

<p> 
And if the symbol is the termination symbol <code >':'</code> behind, so I managed to通せ 
. However, in this case, but with the terms of the reservation <code >':'</code> is <code> a? B: c </code> collision with a colon 
The problem. Even if you can get this resolved. 
</p> 

<p> 
In both cases the two are also possible. That is resolved scanner SU 
Or resolution of the parser. If the resolution scanner, <code> def </code> and <code>. </Code> and <code>: </code> Next to come 
Book word <code> tIDENTIFIER </code> (and) I do. Parser resolve, SOUI 
I write a thousand rules. <code> ruby </code>, three each of both depending on the occasion. 
</p> 



<h3> method definition </h3> 

<p> 
Methods defined portion of the name. This is the side deal with the parser.

<p> 
The format is iterator <code> do </code> in <code> end </code> and <code> (</code> in <code>) </code> There are two types. These two 
The difference in priority order, <code> (</code> in <code>) </code> it is much higher. It is a high priority 
Grammar units as "small", it is smaller than the rule 
. For example <code> stmt </code> well as <code> expr </code> and <code> primary </code> have access to. For example 
I used to be <code> (</code> in <code>) </code> iterator is <code> primary </code>, <code> do </code> in <code> end </code> iterator is < code> stmt </code> was.

However, during a ceremony following the requests came.

This is to allow <code> do </code> in <code> end </code> iterator <code> arg </code> and <code> primary </code>-money. 
But <code> while </code> is conditional expression <code> expr </code>, that is <code> arg </code> and <code> primary </code>, including,

<h3> problem </h3> 

<p> 
This issue is very confusing. This was to pass <code> ruby </code> 1.7 to 
Became, it's fairly recent story. What is that…… 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist">

<p> 
To 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist">

</pre> 

<p> 
Whether or interpretation of the story. Previously the former All are being treated like 
Hoops. That is always parentheses "method arguments in parentheses." But 
<code> ruby </code> 1.7, as the latter now being processed. 
This means the space is in parentheses "<code> expr </code> brackets". 
</p> 

<p> 
Why did you change your interpretation, let me introduce an example. First I wrote the following statement. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
p m () + 1 
</pre> 

<p> 
If there is no problem so far. But <code> m </code> was actually returns to scale, multi-digit number of SU 
GITATOSHIYOU. So when you view it for a whole number. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
p m () + 1. to_i #?? 
</pre> 

<p> 
Darn, parentheses are needed. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
p (m () + 1). to_i 
</pre> 

<p> 
This is not to be interpreted? Up to 1.6, which is 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
(p (m () + 1)). to_i 
</pre> 

<p> 
Said. This means putting a long-awaited <code> to_i </code> What is the meaning they no longer exist. This is not it. 
The space between parentheses but only with the special treatment is <code> expr </code> brackets to the 
Of. 
</p> 

<p> 
Self-study for those who want to keep writing, 
This change was implemented <code> parse.y </code> revision 1.100 (2001-05-31).

<h2> <code> tLPAREN_ARG </code> (2) </h2> 

<h3> problem </h3> 

<p> 
Previous calls to the section on specific methods of expression is "almost ready" and said cover 
The reasons for this. This is not iterator is uncovered. 
For example, the following sentence like water. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a) {....} 
m (a) do .... end 
</pre> 

<p> 
The point of this section is introduced in efforts to resolve the突っこんsection, let's see. 
</p> 

<h3> level of resolution rules </h3> 

<p> 
First look at the rules. 
It has already appeared before the rules just because <code> do_block </code> around to watch them. 
</p>

<p> 
<code> do </code>, <code> (</code> is both radically new symbol <code> kDO_BLOCK </code> and <code> tLBRACE_ARG </code> in the world. 
Why <code> kDO </code> and <code >'{'</code> does not. That's the moment when you try a shot, 
Well, that's all, <code> kDO_BLOCK </code> and <code> kDO </code> to, <code> tLBRACE_ARG </code> and <code >'{'</code> and <code> yacc </code>, 
Treated him. Then…… 
</p> 

<pre class="screen"> 
% Yacc parse.y 
conflicts: 2 shift / reduce, 6 reduce / reduce 
</pre> 

<p> 
Collision with abandon. Investigating the cause of the following statements. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a), b {....} 
</pre> 

<p> 
Because this form of sentence has been through already. <code> b {....}</code> is 
<code> primary </code> said. There are blocks <code> m </code> and consolidated rules to add, however, 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m ((a), b) {....} 
m ((a), (b {....})) 
</pre> 

<p> 
The two were able to interpret it, a collision. 
This is 2 shift / reduce conflict. 
</p> 

<p> 
The other is <code> do </code> in <code> end </code>-related. This is 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m ((a)) do .... end # block_call do have to add end 
m ((a)) do .... end # primary do have to add end 
</pre> 

<p> 
The two collided. This is 6 reduce / reduce conflict.

I just also to foresee. Because the next <code >','</code> or <code >')'</code>, or <code> rule2 </code> and 
<code> rule3 </code> divide. If <code >','</code> This argument would have only a comma delimited 
Will not immediately think of more than two arguments, namely <code> rule3 </code> and determinism. If you are 
Mere <code> a </code>, but <code> if </code>だっliteral or "93" orだっthe same thing. 
The input has been completed at <code> rule2 </code> and <code> rule3 </code> to differentiate, namely 
Arguments over whether an argument or two to differentiate prefetching happens. 
</p> 

<p> 
In this case, all the rules <code >')'</code> before the (separate) and embedded in Action 
It is rather important. Action is the first time, it would no longer run the floor 
Resona standing returns, the parser is "absolutely certain" until the situation of action 
I try to delay the execution. That is why one of those read-ahead to create a situation 
If you are not the parser generation must be eliminated, which means it is "collision".

How? Input C. 
</p>

</pre> 

<p> 
I have come here at <code> rule3 </code> is not only possible, prefetching is like me 
Down. 
</p> 

<p> 
However, it does not work. The following is <code >'('</code> If the method call it, <code >','</code> or <code >')'</code>, 
Do we have to refer to variable. So this is embedded in a reduction of Action 
See the argument for a firm element of prefetching happens. 
</p> 

<p> 
And other input, what of it? The third method calls for example, the argument is 
I would doubt it. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist">

<p> 
All in all, it is necessary prefetching. Because, you <code >','</code> or <code >')'</code> or reducible to shift and 
Former divide. So, this rule will eventually be embedded in every case Action 
Run faster than <code >')'</code> was read. Very confusing. I came up with a sense of well - 
The motion. 
</p> 

<p> 
By the way embedded in the action instead of the usual action <code> lex_state </code> set 
You can not? Thus, for example. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
                 | TLPAREN_ARG ')' (lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;) 
</pre> 

<p> 
This is wrong. Because of the reduction before the action (and) will happen prefetching 
May be. Prefetching is now out of them backfired. This thing 
Were seen, LALR parser prefetching to turn to one's own is not quite a trick. 
Amateurs are not recommended.

<h3> <code> do </code> in <code> end </code> iterator </h3> 

<p> 
So far, <code> (</code> in <code>) </code> enumeration is still ready to deal with the <code> do </code> in <code> end </code> left iterator 
. Iterators in the same manner as if he could handle, but it is different. 
<code> (</code> in <code>) </code> and <code> do </code> in <code> end </code> will have different priorities. For example follows. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m a, b {....} # m (a, (b {....})) 
m a, b do .... end # m (a, b) do .... end 
</pre> 

<p> 
So of course deal with different approaches are appropriate. 
</p> 

<p> 
But, of course, deal with the same case as it goes. For example, the following cases: 
Both will be the same. 
</p> 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a) {....} 
m (a) do .... end 
</pre>
