    <h1>Chapter 17: Dynamic evaluation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I have already finished to describe about the mechanism of the evaluator by the
previous chapter.
In this chapter, by including the parser in addition to it,
let&#8217;s examine the big picture as &#8220;the evaluator in a broad sense&#8221;.
There are three targets: <code>eval</code>, <code>Module#module_eval</code> and
<code>Object#instance_eval</code>.</p>
<h3><code>eval</code></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve already described about <code>eval</code>,
but I&#8217;ll introduce more tiny things about it here.</p>
<p>By using <code>eval</code>, you can compile and evaluate a string at runtime in the place.
Its return value is the value of the last expression of the program.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
p eval("1 + 1")   # 2
</pre>
<p>You can also refer to a variable in its scope from inside of a string to <code>eval</code>.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
lvar = 5
@ivar = 6
p eval("lvar + @ivar")   # 11
</pre>
<p>Readers who have been reading until here cannot simply read and pass over the
word &#8220;its scope&#8221;. For instance, you are curious about how is its &#8220;scope&#8221; of
constants, aren&#8217;t you? I am. To put the bottom line first, basically you
can think it directly inherits the environment of outside of <code>eval</code>.</p>
<p>And you can also define methods and define classes.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
def a
  eval('class C;  def test() puts("ok") end   end')
end

a()          # define class C and C#test
C.new.test   # shows ok
</pre>
<p>Moreover, as mentioned a little in the previous chapter,
when you pass a <code>Proc</code> as the second argument, the string can be evaluated in
its environment.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
def new_env
  n = 5
  Proc.new { nil }   # turn the environment of this method into an object and return it
end

p eval('n * 3', new_env())   # 15
</pre>
<h3><code>module_eval</code> and <code>instance_eval</code></h3>
<p>When a <code>Proc</code> is passed as the second argument of <code>eval</code>, the evaluations can be
done in its environment. <code>module_eval</code> and <code>instance_eval</code> is its limited (or
shortcut) version. With <code>module_eval</code>, you can evaluate in an environment that
is as if in a module statement or a class statement.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
lvar = "toplevel lvar"   # a local variable to confirm this scope

module M
end
M.module_eval(&lt;&lt;'EOS')   # a suitable situation to use here-document
    p lvar   # referable
    p self   # shows M
    def ok   # define M#ok
      puts 'ok'
    end
EOS
</pre>
<p>With <code>instance_eval</code>, you can evaluate in an environment whose <code>self</code> of the
singleton class statement is the object.</p>
<pre class="emlist">
lvar = "toplevel lvar"   # a local variable to confirm this scope

obj = Object.new
obj.instance_eval(&lt;&lt;'EOS')
    p lvar   # referable
    p self   # shows #&lt;Object:0x40274f5c&gt;
    def ok   # define obj.ok
      puts 'ok'
    end
EOS
</pre>
<p>Additionally, these <code>module_eval</code> and <code>instance_eval</code> can also be used as
iterators, a block is evaluated in each environment in that case.
For instance,</p>
<pre class="emlist">
obj = Object.new
p obj                 # #&lt;Object:0x40274fac&gt;
obj.instance_eval {
    p self            # #&lt;Object:0x40274fac&gt;
}
</pre>
<p>Like this.</p>
<p>However, between the case when using a string and the case when using a block,
the behavior around local variables is different each other.
For example, when creating a block in the <code>a</code> method then doing <code>instance_eval</code>
it in the <code>b</code> method, the block would refer to the local variables of <code>a</code>.
When creating a string in the <code>a</code> method then doing <code>instance_eval</code> it in the
<code>b</code> method, from inside of the string, it would refer to the local variables of <code>b</code>.
The scope of local variables is decided &#8220;at compile time&#8221;,
the consequence differs because a string is compiled every time but a block is
compiled when loading files.</p>
<h2><code>eval</code></h2>
<h3><code>eval()</code></h3>
<p>The <code>eval</code> of Ruby branches many times based on the presence and absence of the
parameters. Let&#8217;s assume the form of call is limited to the below:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
eval(prog_string, some_block)
</pre>
<p>Then, since this makes the actual interface function <code>rb_f_eval()</code> almost
meaningless, we&#8217;ll start with the function <code>eval()</code> which is one step lower.
The function prototype of <code>eval()</code> is:</p>
<pre class="emlist">
static VALUE
eval(VALUE self, VALUE src, VALUE scope, char *file, int line);
</pre>
<p><code>scope</code> is the <code>Proc</code> of the second parameter.
<code>file</code> and <code>line</code> is the file name and line number of where a string to <code>eval</code>
is supposed to be located. Then, let&#8217;s see the content:</p>

<p>If this function is shown without any preamble, you probably feel &#8220;oww!&#8221;.
But we&#8217;ve defeated many functions of <code>eval.c</code> until here,
so this is not enough to be an enemy of us.
This function is just continuously saving/restoring the stacks.
The points we need to care about are only the below three:</p>
<ul>
	<li>unusually <code>FRAME</code> is also replaced (not copied and pushed)</li>
	<li><code>ruby_cref</code> is substituted (?) by <code>ruby_frame-&gt;cbase</code></li>
	<li>only <code>scope_vmode</code> is not simply restored but influences <code>data</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the main parts are the <code>compile()</code> and <code>eval_node()</code> located around the
middle. Though it&#8217;s possible that <code>eval_node()</code> has already been forgotten,
it is the function to start the evaluation of the parameter <code>node</code>.
It was also used in <code>ruby_run()</code>.</p>
<p>Here is <code>compile()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>compile()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
4968  static NODE*
4969  compile(src, file, line)
4970      VALUE src;
4971      char *file;
4972      int line;
4973  {
4974      NODE *node;
4975
4976      ruby_nerrs = 0;
4977      Check_Type(src, T_STRING);
4978      node = rb_compile_string(file, src, line);
4979
4980      if (ruby_nerrs == 0) return node;
4981      return 0;
4982  }

(eval.c)
</pre>
<p><code>ruby_nerrs</code> is the variable incremented in <code>yyerror()</code>.
In other words, if this variable is non-zero, it indicates more than one parse
error happened. And, <code>rb_compile_string()</code> was already discussed in Part 2.
It was a function to compile a Ruby string into a syntax tree.</p>
<p>One thing becomes a problem here is local variable.
As we&#8217;ve seen in Chapter 12: Syntax tree construction,
local variables are managed by using <code>lvtbl</code>.
However, since a <code>SCOPE</code> (and possibly also <code>VARS</code>) already exists,
we need to parse in the way of writing over and adding to it.
This is in fact the heart of <code>eval()</code>,
and is the worst difficult part.
Let&#8217;s go back to <code>parse.y</code> again and complete this investigation.</p>
<h3><code>top_local</code></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned that the functions named <code>local_push() local_pop()</code> are used
when pushing <code>struct local_vars</code>, which is the management table of local
variables,
but actually there&#8217;s one more pair of functions to push the management table.
It is the pair of <code>top_local_init()</code> and <code>top_local_setup()</code>.
They are called in this sort of way.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ How  <code>top_local_init()</code>  is called </p>

<pre class="longlist">
program :   { top_local_init(); }
          compstmt
            { top_local_setup(); }
</pre>
<p>Of course, in actuality various other things are also done,
but all of them are cut here because it&#8217;s not important.
And this is the content of it:</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>top_local_init()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5273  static void
5274  top_local_init()
5275  {
5276      local_push(1);
5277      lvtbl-&gt;cnt = ruby_scope-&gt;local_tbl?ruby_scope-&gt;local_tbl[0]:0;
5278      if (lvtbl-&gt;cnt &gt; 0) {
5279          lvtbl-&gt;tbl = ALLOC_N(ID, lvtbl-&gt;cnt+3);
5280          MEMCPY(lvtbl-&gt;tbl, ruby_scope-&gt;local_tbl, ID, lvtbl-&gt;cnt+1);
5281      }
5282      else {
5283          lvtbl-&gt;tbl = 0;
5284      }
5285      if (ruby_dyna_vars)
5286          lvtbl-&gt;dlev = 1;
5287      else
5288          lvtbl-&gt;dlev = 0;
5289  }

(parse.y)
</pre>
<p>This means that <code>local_tbl</code> is copied from <code>ruby_scope</code> to <code>lvtbl</code>.
As for block local variables, since it&#8217;s better to see them all at once later,
we&#8217;ll focus on ordinary local variables for the time being.
Next, here is <code>top_local_setup()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>top_local_setup()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5291  static void
5292  top_local_setup()
5293  {

5295      int i;                 /* the number of local varaibles before parsing */

5299
5300          if (i &lt; len) {
5301              if (i == 0 || (ruby_scope-&gt;flags &amp; SCOPE_MALLOC) == 0) {
5302                  VALUE *vars = ALLOC_N(VALUE, len+1);

5307                  }
5308                  else {
5309                      *vars++ = 0;
5310                      rb_mem_clear(vars, len);
5311                  }
5312                  ruby_scope-&gt;local_vars = vars;
5313                  ruby_scope-&gt;flags |= SCOPE_MALLOC;
5314              }
5315              else {
5316                  VALUE *vars = ruby_scope-&gt;local_vars-1;
5317                  REALLOC_N(vars, VALUE, len+1);
5318                  ruby_scope-&gt;local_vars = vars+1;
5319                  rb_mem_clear(ruby_scope-&gt;local_vars+i, len-i);
5320              }
5321              if (ruby_scope-&gt;local_tbl &amp;&amp;
                      ruby_scope-&gt;local_vars[-1] == 0) {
5322                  free(ruby_scope-&gt;local_tbl);
5323              }
5324              ruby_scope-&gt;local_vars[-1] = 0;  /* NODE is not necessary anymore */
5325              ruby_scope-&gt;local_tbl = local_tbl();
5326          }
5327      }
5328      local_pop();
5329  }

(parse.y)
</pre>
<p>Since <code>local_vars</code> can be either in the stack or in the heap, it makes the code
complex to some extent. However, this is just updating <code>local_tbl</code> and
<code>local_vars</code> of <code>ruby_scope</code>. (When <code>SCOPE_MALLOC</code> was set, <code>local_vars</code> was
allocated by <code>malloc()</code>). And here, because there&#8217;s no meaning of using <code>alloca()</code>,
it is forced to change its allocation method to <code>malloc</code>.</p>
<h3>Block Local Variable</h3>
<p>By the way, how about block local variables?
To think about this, we have to go back to the entry point of the parser first,
it is <code>yycompile()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ setting  <code>ruby_dyna_vars</code>  aside</p>

<pre class="longlist">
static NODE*
yycompile(f, line)
{
    struct RVarmap *vars = ruby_dyna_vars;
         :
    n = yyparse();
         :
    ruby_dyna_vars = vars;
}
</pre>
<p>This looks like a mere save-restore, but the point is that this does not clear
the <code>ruby_dyna_vars</code>. This means that also in the parser it directly adds
elements to the link of <code>RVarmap</code> created in the evaluator.</p>
<p>However, according to the previous description, the structure of
<code>ruby_dyna_vars</code> differs between the parser and the evalutor.
How does it deal with the difference in the way of attaching the header
(<code>RVarmap</code> whose <code>id=0</code>)?</p>
<p>What is helpful here is the &#8220;1&#8221; of <code>local_push(1)</code> in <code>top_local_init()</code>.
When the argument of <code>local_push()</code> becomes true,
it does not attach the first header of <code>ruby_dyna_vars</code>.
It means, it would look like Figure 1. Now, it is assured that
we can refer to the block local variables of the outside scope
from inside of a string to <code>eval</code>.</p>
<div class="image">
<p><img src="images/ch_anyeval_dynavars.jpg" alt="(dynavars)"><br>

	<li>評価機で作成 created in the evaluator
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s sure we can refer to,
but didn&#8217;t you say that <code>ruby_dyna_vars</code> is entirely freed in the parser?
What can we do if the link created at the evaluator will be freed?
&#8230;
I&#8217;d like the readers who noticed this to be relieved by reading the next part.</p>

<p>It is designed so that the loop would stop
when it reaches the link created at the evaluator (<code>vars</code>).</p>
<h2><code>instance_eval</code></h2>
<h3>The Whole Picture</h3>
<p>The substance of <code>Module#module_eval</code> is <code>rb_mod_module_eval()</code>,
and the substance of <code>Object#instance_eval</code> is <code>rb_obj_instance_eval()</code>.</p>

<p>These two methods have a common part as &#8220;a method to replace <code>self</code> with <code>class</code>&#8221;,
that part is defined as <code>specific_eval()</code>.
Figure 2 shows it and also what will be described.
What with parentheses are calls by function pointers.</p>

<p>Whichever <code>instance_eval</code> or <code>module_eval</code>,
it can accept both a block and a string,
thus it branches for each particular process to <code>yield</code> and <code>eval</code> respectively.
However, most of them are also common again,
this part is extracted as <code>exec_under()</code>.</p>
<p>But for those who reading, one have to simultaneously face at 2 times 2 = 4 ways,
it is not a good plan. Therefore, here we assume only the case when</p>
<ol start="1">
	<li>it is an <code>instance_eval</code></li>
	<li>which takes a string as its argument</li>
</ol>
<p>. And extracting all functions under <code>rb_obj_instance_eval()</code> in-line,
folding constants, we&#8217;ll read the result.</p>
<h3>After Absorbed</h3>
<p>After all,
it becomes very comprehensible in comparison to the one before being absorbed.</p>

<p>It seems that this pushes the singleton class of the object to <code>CLASS</code> and
<code>CREF</code> and <code>ruby_frame-&gt;cbase</code>.
The main process is one-shot of <code>eval()</code>.
It is unusual that things such as initializing <code>FRAME</code> by a struct-copy are
missing, but this is also not create so much difference.</p>
<h3>Before being absorbed</h3>
<p>Though the author said it becomes more friendly to read,
it&#8217;s possible it has been already simple since it was not absorbed,
let&#8217;s check where is simplified in comparison to the before-absorbed one.</p>
<p>The first one is <code>specific_eval()</code>. Since this function is to share the code of
the interface to Ruby, almost all parts of it is to parse the parameters.
Here is the result of cutting them all.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>specific_eval()</code> (simplified)</p>

<pre class="longlist">
5258  static VALUE
5259  specific_eval(argc, argv, klass, self)
5260      int argc;
5261      VALUE *argv;
5262      VALUE klass, self;
5263  {
5264      if (rb_block_given_p()) {

5268          return yield_under(klass, self);
5269      }
5270      else {

5294          return eval_under(klass, self, argv[0], file, line);
5295      }
5296  }

(eval.c)
</pre>
<p>As you can see, this is perfectly branches in two ways based on whether there&#8217;s
a block or not, and each route would never influence the other.
Therefore, when reading, we should read one by one.
To begin with, the absorbed version is enhanced in this point.</p>
<p>And <code>file</code> and <code>line</code> are irrelevant when reading <code>yield_under()</code>,
thus in the case when the route of <code>yield</code> is absorbed by the main body,
it might become obvious that we don&#8217;t have to think about the parse of these
parameters at all.</p>
<p>Next, we&#8217;ll look at <code>eval_under()</code> and <code>eval_under_i()</code>.</p>
<p class="caption">▼ <code>eval_under()</code> </p>

<pre class="longlist">
5222  static VALUE
5223  eval_under(under, self, src, file, line)
5224      VALUE under, self, src;
5225      const char *file;
5226      int line;
5227  {
5228      VALUE args[4];
5229
5230      if (ruby_safe_level &gt;= 4) {
5231          StringValue(src);
5232      }
5233      else {
5234          SafeStringValue(src);
5235      }
5236      args[0] = self;
5237      args[1] = src;
5238      args[2] = (VALUE)file;
5239      args[3] = (VALUE)line;
5240      return exec_under(eval_under_i, under, under, args);
5241  }

5214  static VALUE
5215  eval_under_i(args)
5216      VALUE *args;
5217  {
5218      return eval(args[0], args[1], Qnil, (char*)args[2], (int)args[3]);
5219  }

(eval.c)
</pre>
<p>In this function, in order to make its arguments single,
it stores them into the <code>args</code> array and passes it.
We can imagine that this <code>args</code> exists as a temporary container to pass from
<code>eval_under()</code> to <code>eval_under_i()</code>,
but not sure that it is truly so.
It&#8217;s possible that <code>args</code> is modified inside <code>evec_under()</code>.</p>
<p>As a way to share a code, this is a very right way to do.
But for those who read it, this kind of indirect passing is incomprehensible.
Particularly, because there are extra castings for <code>file</code> and <code>line</code> to fool
the compiler, it is hard to imagine what were their actual types.
The parts around this entirely disappeared in the absorbed version,
so you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting lost.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s too much to say that absorbing and extracting always makes things
easier to understand.
For example, when calling <code>exec_under()</code>, <code>under</code> is passed as both the second
and third arguments, but is it all right if the <code>exec_under()</code> side extracts
the both parameter variables into <code>under</code>?
That is to say, the second and third arguments of <code>exec_under()</code> are, in fact,
indicating <code>CLASS</code> and <code>CREF</code> that should be pushed.
<code>CLASS</code> and <code>CREF</code> are &#8220;different things&#8221;,
it might be better to use different variables.
Also in the previous absorbed version, for only this point,</p>
<pre class="emlist">
VALUE sclass = .....;
VALUE cbase = sclass;
</pre>
<p>I thought that I would write this way,
but also thought it could give the strange impression
if abruptly only these variables are left,
thus it was extracted as <code>sclass</code>.
It means that this is only because of the flow of the texts.</p>
<p>By now, so many times, I&#8217;ve extracted arguments and functions,
and for each time I repeatedly explained the reason to extract.
They are</p>
<ul>
	<li>there are only a few possible patterns</li>
	<li>the behavior can slightly change</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely, I&#8217;m not saying
&#8220;In whatever ways extracting various things always makes things simpler&#8221;.</p>
<p>In whatever case, what of the first priority is the comprehensibility for
ourself and not keep complying the methodology.
When extracting makes things simpler, extract it.
When we feel that not extracting or conversely bundling as a procedure makes
things easier to understand, let us do it.
As for <code>ruby</code>, I often extracted them because the original is written properly,
but if a source code was written by a poor programmer,
aggressively bundling to functions should often become a good choice.</p>
