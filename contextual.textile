
h1. Chapter 11: State Equipped Scanner


h2. Summary
 
In theory, the scanner simply  divides a source line in tokens.&nbsp&nbsp The parser
then steps through the tokens branching as appropriate to compute the desired action.&nbsp&nbsp 
It would seem that scanner and the parser could act independently.&nbsp&nbsp But as usual with 
real world,&nbsp it does not work out that way.
 
 
It turns out that the scanner and parser have to work together.&nbsp&nbsp The result for Ruby is a reasonably complex state machine driven scanner that feeds the parser to produce the correct result.&nbsp&nbsp To be clear,&nbsp  both the scanner and the parser manipulate the state variable of the scanner.&nbsp&nbsp In other words, the scanner and the parser are talking to each other.
 



h3. Concrete example

 
In many languages white-space outside string literals does not greatly effect the language.&nbsp&nbsp Source lines are often terminated explicitly.&nbsp&nbsp  In 'C' a source line is terminated with a semi-colon ( ';' )&nbsp  or the closing of a block (i.e. '}' ). 

 
For Ruby the interpretation of a statement can change completely when additional tokens are processed.&nbsp&nbsp The source fragment "a[i]" can be,&nbsp depending on context,&nbsp either an <i>indexed variable</i>&nbsp or a <i>method call with implicit parenthesis's</i>.
 
<pre class="graylist">
a[i] = 1                # a[i] = (1) - Index substitution 
a[i]                    # a([i])     - Method with implicit parameter.
</pre>
 
This sort of dramatic change in interpretation occurs in Ruby because the language itself is has a very flexible syntax.&nbsp&nbsp Ask yourself,&nbsp how many languages allow implicit parenthesis's?&nbsp&nbsp 
 
 
Ruby's flexible syntax means that a blank can change how a statement is interpreted by Ruby.&nbsp  Consider the following two statements: 
 
<pre class="graylist">
a + 1              # (a) + (1)
a +1               #  a (+1)
</pre>
 
The first example is interpreted as:  &lt;variable&gt &lt;op&gt &lt;literal integer&gt.&nbsp&nbsp The second is interpreted as: &lt;method&gt &lt;literal integer parameter&gt.&nbsp&nbsp The same setup in 'C',&nbsp for example,&nbsp  would be interpreted identically.
 
 
The bottom line is that the parsing and scanning is more complex with Ruby.&nbsp&nbsp The following sections will attempt to break the scanner down into small enough pieces to be understood.
 

h3. `Function yylex()`
 
The heart of the lexical scanner is <b>yylex()</b>.&nbsp&nbsp This function is often generated with the programs such as <b>lex</b>&nbsp or <b>flex</b>.&nbsp&nbsp In the case of Ruby,&nbsp the complexity of this function necessitated a hand written <i>State Equipped Scanner</i>&nbsp  that interacts the a <i>Bison</i> generated parser. 
 
 
The following sections discuss the various scanner states and their functions. 
 
h3. `Lex_state`

The current <i>state</i>&nbsp of the scanner is maintained the variable <b><i>lex_state</i></b>.&nbsp&nbsp It's declaration and the definition of it's enumerated states follows:
 
<pre class="greenlist">
static enum lex_state {
    EXPR_BEG,        /* ignore newline, +/- is a sign.              */
    EXPR_END,        /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_ARG,        /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_CMDARG,     /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_ENDARG,     /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_MID,        /* newline significant, +/- is an operator.    */
    EXPR_FNAME,      /* ignore newline, no reserved words.          */
    EXPR_DOT,        /* right after `.' or `::', no reserved words. */
    EXPR_CLASS,      /* immediate after `class', no here document.  */
} lex_state;

(parse.y)
</pre>
 
The prefix <b>'EXPR_'</b>&nbsp means <i>expression</i>.&nbsp&nbsp It is used remind us that the scanner is a expression processing engine.
 
 
Specifically, EXPR_BEG indicates the <i>beginning of the expression</i>. EXPR_END indicates the <i>end of the expression</i>, EXPR_ARG <i>before method arguments</i>, and EXPR_FNAME before the name of the method (def, etc).

Show. ` EXPR_FNAME ` is "(` def ` and others) in the name of the method".飛ばexplanation 
After the analysis of them in detail. 
 

 
By the way, ` lex_state ` shows that are "in parentheses after" "head sentence", rather it 
The addition of that information, so that the scanner rather than the state of the state like parser 
Feel. But the scanner is usually called the state. Why? 
 

 
In fact, in this case, "state" is usually used "state" is a little different meaning. 
` lex_state ` like "state" and the "state of the scanner would behave" 
Means. For example ` EXPR_BEG ` to precisely "We own head scanner 
Beginning of a sentence or salted cod to move like a state. " 
 

 
In technical terms, use the scanner to see if the state machine and the state, say 
Be. But what is there to explain the topics are too hard to break away from the SU

*  reserved word ` if ` immediately after  
 

 
And so on. 
 


h3.  implementation  

 
Such a grammar to achieve what? Simply scanner 
Skip a line break is not alone. Ruby as a reserved word in a sentence ends区切 
In the C language grammar is not about the collision, tried it lightly, ` return `, 
` next `, ` break `, the method calls are cut back and通らなかったomitted parentheses. 
That's the end of a sentence is to leave the sign will not have some form of termination. 
That's ` \ n ` or <code >';'` regardless of whether they simply mark the end of some 
Needed. 
 

 
There are two solutions. That is parser or resolve or settle in the scanner. 
Parser would be resolved, ` \ n ` be allowed at all options ` \ n ` to rest 
Grammar kick like if I can write. If you settle in the scanner, ` \ n ` meaningful 
Where there is only ` \ n ` I pass a parser (skip other locations). 
 

 
Whether to use is a question of taste, but usually respond to the scanner. The more you 
I have a small number, and what the rules are messing about good sign 
PASAJENERETA in the use of those means they are missing. 
 

 
That's not to say in conclusion ` ruby ` new line is also dealing with the scanner. Successive lines 
When you want to continue ` \ n ` skip to the end you want ` \ n ` send as a token. 
That's ` yylex () ` here.

Ruby is a reserved word in a method to use that name. However name of the method to use 
And a mouthful to say but there are some context,

*  call (` obj.xxxx `)  
*  literal symbols (`: xxxx `)  
 

 
The three could be used. Ruby is all this is possible. Each of the following 
Let us consider. 
 

 
First, define the method has its own reserved words ` def ` likely to be preceded by, so we managed. 
 

 
Method calls for the receiver to skip a lot of difficulty will be that of 
Of them, but further specification is not limited to, and those are not allowed. - 
Book word method means that if the name is never a receiver can not be omitted. Or 
Is that right Perth designed to be able to say what might be the

And if the symbol is the termination symbol <code >':'` behind, so I managed to通せ 
. However, in this case, but with the terms of the reservation <code >':'` is ` a? B: c ` collision with a colon 
The problem. Even if you can get this resolved. 
 

 
In both cases the two are also possible. That is resolved scanner SU 
Or resolution of the parser. If the resolution scanner, ` def ` and `. </Code> and `: ` Next to come

Whether or interpretation of the story. Previously the former All are being treated like 
Hoops. That is always parentheses "method arguments in parentheses." But 
` ruby ` 1.7, as the latter now being processed. 
This means the space is in parentheses "` expr ` brackets". 
 

 
Why did you change your interpretation, let me introduce an example. First I wrote the following statement. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
p m () + 1 
</pre> 

 
If there is no problem so far. But ` m ` was actually returns to scale, multi-digit number of SU 
GITATOSHIYOU. So when you view it for a whole number. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
p m () + 1. to_i #?? 
</pre> 

 
Darn, parentheses are needed. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
p (m () + 1). to_i 
</pre> 

 
This is not to be interpreted? Up to 1.6, which is 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
(p (m () + 1)). to_i 
</pre> 

 
Said. This means putting a long-awaited ` to_i ` What is the meaning they no longer exist. This is not it. 
The space between parentheses but only with the special treatment is ` expr ` brackets to the 
Of. 
 

 
Self-study for those who want to keep writing, 
This change was implemented ` parse.y ` revision 1.100 (2001-05-31). 
1.99 and that's why we take a look at the differences between the relatively straightforward. 
This difference is to take command.

Fair incidentally, let us also take a look at the expression in parentheses.

The ceremony is usually in parentheses ` tLPAREN ` like. 
 

 
I put it all together.

<tr> <td> ` m (a) ` <td> <td> ` tLPAREN_ARG ` <td> </tr> 
<tr> <td> ` (a) ` <td> <td> ` tLPAREN ` <td> </tr> 
 

 
That is how we distinguish between these three are the focus. 
This is particularly ` tLPAREN_ARG ` is important.

The first ` if ` is ` tLPAREN ` So the usual formula in parentheses. The criterion is ` lex_state ` is 
` BEG ` or ` MID `, that is absolutely the beginning when the ceremony. 
 

 
The next ` space_seen ` parentheses is the "blank whether there is any" respectively. 
Spaces, and ` lex_state ` is ` ARG ` or ` CMDARG ` That is when the first argument……

Considering the compatibility considerations must be managed. 
 

 
But without thinking

` arg ` from ` primary ` is out. From there ` tLPAREN_ARG ` rules out.

h2.  ` tLPAREN_ARG ` (2)  

h3.  problem  

 
Previous calls to the section on specific methods of expression is "almost ready" and said cover 
The reasons for this. This is not iterator is uncovered. 
For example, the following sentence like water. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a) {....} 
m (a) do .... end 
</pre> 

 
The point of this section is introduced in efforts to resolve the突っこんsection, let's see. 
 

h3.  level of resolution rules  

 
First look at the rules. 
It has already appeared before the rules just because ` do_block ` around to watch them.

` do `, ` (` is both radically new symbol ` kDO_BLOCK ` and ` tLBRACE_ARG ` in the world. 
Why ` kDO ` and <code >'{'` does not. That's the moment when you try a shot, 
Well, that's all, ` kDO_BLOCK ` and ` kDO ` to, ` tLBRACE_ARG ` and <code >'{'` and ` yacc `, 
Treated him. Then…… 
 

<pre class="screen">

</pre> 

 
Collision with abandon. Investigating the cause of the following statements. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a), b {....} 
</pre> 

 
Because this form of sentence has been through already. ` b {....}` is 
` primary ` said. There are blocks ` m ` and consolidated rules to add, however, 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m ((a), b) {....} 
m ((a), (b {....})) 
</pre> 

 
The two were able to interpret it, a collision. 
This is 2 shift / reduce conflict. 
 

 
The other is ` do ` in ` end `-related. This is 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m ((a)) do .... end # block_call do have to add end 
m ((a)) do .... end # primary do have to add end 
</pre> 

 
The two collided. This is 6 reduce / reduce conflict.

Action rules are embedded as a substitute check can be. For example 
Rule 1 as an example and take an entirely without changing the meaning of the following rewrite.

I ` tmp ` and before the end of one-minute mark is the possibility of being prefetched 
Since the (empty) ` tmp ` to read the following SURINUKE is certainly possible. 
And, absolutely prefetching know if it will happen, ` lex_state ` is the assignment

This rule is <code >')'` prefetching is absolutely going to be? 
 

h4.  prefetching guarantee  

 
This is, in fact credible. Following three to take the input. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m () (nil) # A 
m (a) (nil) # B 
m (a, b, c) (nil) # C 
</pre> 

 
Incidentally the rules a little easier to read (but without changing the situation) rewritten. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
rule1: tLPAREN_ARG e1 ')' 
rule2: tLPAREN_ARG one_arg e2 ')' 
rule3: tLPAREN_ARG more_args e3 ')' 

e1: / * empty * / 
e2: / * empty * / 
e3: / * empty * / 
</pre> 

 
First of all, type A's. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (# ... tLPAREN_ARG 
</pre> 

 
Until I read it ` e1 ` come before. If ` e1 ` to the reduction of those 
Another rule is to choose the other for the ` e1 ` to the reduction ` rule1 ` or commit suicide, 
Or other rules to make choices in order to make sure this happens prefetching. 
Therefore input ` rule1 ` If you are sure to meet <code >')'` of the prefetched. 
 

 
Then the B input. First 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (# ... tLPAREN_ARG 
</pre> 

 
We will, until I just read-ahead to take the same reason. And 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a # ... tLPAREN_ARG '(' tIDENTIFIER 
</pre> 

 
I just also to foresee. Because the next <code >','` or <code >')'`, or ` rule2 ` and 
` rule3 ` divide. If <code >','` This argument would have only a comma delimited 
Will not immediately think of more than two arguments, namely ` rule3 ` and determinism. If you are 
Mere ` a `, but ` if `だっliteral or "93" orだっthe same thing. 
The input has been completed at ` rule2 ` and ` rule3 ` to differentiate, namely 
Arguments over whether an argument or two to differentiate prefetching happens. 
 

 
In this case, all the rules <code >')'` before the (separate) and embedded in Action 
It is rather important. Action is the first time, it would no longer run the floor 
Resona standing returns, the parser is "absolutely certain" until the situation of action 
I try to delay the execution. That is why one of those read-ahead to create a situation 
If you are not the parser generation must be eliminated, which means it is "collision". 
 

 
How? Input C. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a, b, c 
</pre> 

 
I have come here at ` rule3 ` is not only possible, prefetching is like me 
Down. 
 

 
However, it does not work. The following is <code >'('` If the method call it, <code >','` or <code >')'`, 
Do we have to refer to variable. So this is embedded in a reduction of Action 
See the argument for a firm element of prefetching happens. 
 

 
And other input, what of it? The third method calls for example, the argument is 
I would doubt it. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a, b, c (....) # ... ',' method_call 
</pre> 

 
All in all, it is necessary prefetching. Because, you <code >','` or <code >')'` or reducible to shift and 
Former divide. So, this rule will eventually be embedded in every case Action 
Run faster than <code >')'` was read. Very confusing. I came up with a sense of well - 
The motion. 
 

 
By the way embedded in the action instead of the usual action ` lex_state ` set 
You can not? Thus, for example. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
                 | TLPAREN_ARG ')' (lex_state = EXPR_ENDARG;) 
</pre> 

 
This is wrong. Because of the reduction before the action (and) will happen prefetching 
May be. Prefetching is now out of them backfired. This thing 
Were seen, LALR parser prefetching to turn to one's own is not quite a trick. 
Amateurs are not recommended. 
 



h3.  ` do ` in ` end ` iterator  

 
So far, ` (` in `) ` enumeration is still ready to deal with the ` do ` in ` end ` left iterator 
. Iterators in the same manner as if he could handle, but it is different. 
` (` in `) ` and ` do ` in ` end ` will have different priorities. For example follows. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m a, b {....} # m (a, (b {....})) 
m a, b do .... end # m (a, b) do .... end 
</pre> 

 
So of course deal with different approaches are appropriate. 
 

 
But, of course, deal with the same case as it goes. For example, the following cases: 
Both will be the same. 
 

<pre class="emlist"> 
m (a) {....} 
m (a) do .... end

Back in parentheses call the method of argument, and not when the first argument before. 
It is ` command_call ` after the second argument. So this kind of footage.

Why ` EXPR_CMDARG ` to eliminate if it has to do with…… you'll find examples of writing.

h3.  facts and the truth  

 
I thought at the end? Is not the end yet. 
Certainly that is a complete logic, but it is correct, I wrote that story. 
In fact, this section is one of lies. 
 

 
Rather than lies not say what exactly? It is 
` CMDARG_P () ` I wrote about this part. 
 

 
Apparently, ` command_args ` parenthesis means that during abbreviatory argument method calls 
If you are ` CMDARG_P () ` is true.

The first argument in the first reading at the time of termination symbol ` CMDARG_P () ` is truly 
It. Therefore 
 

 
Back in parentheses method invocation of the first argument 
Immediately after the first sign of the end of the last argument to mark the end of the next 
 

 
Is the complete answer. 
 

 
The fact is what you mean? But I want to recall, ` CMDARG_P () ` to 
Such codes are used.

` EXPR_CMDARG ` is "` command_call ` arguments before the first", in the sense that it excluded 
. However, ` CMDARG_P () ` is already included in the meaning of that? 
That is the final conclusion of this section is this. 
 

 
EXPR_CMDARG is only a waste.

Conclusions from it and once again the influence of prefetching. ` command_args ` is always 
Following context.

It is, it is too variable to refer to the method calls too. Also 
Variable would have to refer ` variable `, the method it calls ` operation ` return to 
If you do not. So should prefetching to determine the direction forward, so I can not 
Be. Thus ` command_args ` prefetching is beginning to happen is always the first argument 
The first sign after reading the termination ` CMDARG_PUSH () ` execution. 
 

 
` cmdarg_stack `, ` POP ` and ` LEXPOP ` is also divided into the reasons here. 
Look at the following example.
